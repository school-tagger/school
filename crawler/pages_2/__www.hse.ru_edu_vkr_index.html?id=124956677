	<div style="padding-top:3px; font-size: 1.4rem;">After the end of the Cultural Revolution there was an acute shortage of qualified specialists in China. In this regard Chinese government under the personal leadership of Deng Xiaoping issued a number of regulations that stimulated students and young scholars to go abroad for study. Subsequently, this policy of &ldquo;enrichment of brains abroad&rdquo; was further developed. Young specialists and scholars that decided to come back to the motherland received privileges in employment, high salaries and all opportunities to continue their research activities in China. Nowadays, scholars, who have experience of working in foreign universities and companies, occupy high positions in governmental agencies, and many of them have become prominent political figures.In the time of global economic turmoil, China that has become the second or even the first largest economy in the world has to find new ways of further development. In this regard, the experience of specialists, who are familiar with the economic and political systems of other countries, has become crucial important. Occupying high-ranking positions, they can contribute much to the future prosperity of their motherland.This paper analyzes the twists and turns of the PRC&rsquo;s governmental policies toward overseas Chinese students and scholars after the beginning of the economic reforms in 1978. It also examines the created mechanism of incorporating the returnees into the Chinese social system and considers the returned overseas Chinese specialists as a new intellectual elite.The research has been written on the basis of the Chinese main legislation acts while also including materials of the relevant government organizations, and it is based primarily on the concepts of the Systems and Elite theories. Finally, this research comes to the conclusion, that nowadays the returned overseas Chinese scholars and students form a new intellectual elite in China. In addition to the high level of education, experience of studying in the most prestigious foreign universities makes them more liberal and open-minded. They not only occupy high positions in the government, but also control the biggest part of Internet technologies in China that is the most relevant sphere of the global economy. The returned overseas Chinese have their own political representation &ndash; the Zhigongdang party, one of eight legally recognized political parties in China. Moreover, the head of the party Wan Gang in 2007 became the head of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology and the first minister since the 1950s that was not the member of the Communist Party. Also overseas Chinese have a number of various organizations in China and all over the world that provide for their members forums to exchange ideas and share professional experience.There are still many issues that still demand solution. Perhaps, now the Chinese leadership needs to focus all the attention on the already-returned talents, rather than to attract more and more overseas Chinese specialists to the country. Especially, when there is no adequate assurance that returnees have supportive working environment. However, even taking all these factors into account, China&rsquo;s initiatives in this sphere accepted by the central government and local authorities are likely to be successful.After the end of the Cultural Revolution there was an acute shortage of qualified specialists in China.
