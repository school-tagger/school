Introduction

There exist numerous types of compensation schemes. In practice, though, not necessarily optimal,
hourly and monthly rates most of the time. Questions widely addressed among economists are why do

organizations choose one incentive payment scheme over the others and does there even exist an optimal

and feasible one? Answers to those question are of a vital importance to economic theory and thus vast

majority of papers on this topic are devoted to comparison of diﬀerent incentive compensation schemes.

One possible classiﬁcation framework for incentive payment schemes is dividing them into compen-

sations based on absolute and relative performance. The former of the two takes into account absolute

level of output produced by an agent, while the latter uses information on relative position of the agent’s

output, compared to that of other agents. On one extreme of this classiﬁcation lays individual piece-rate,

under which an agent receives a payment linearly dependent on her absolute performance, on the other -

rank-order tournament, where the payment to the agent depends on her rank, i.e. her performance relative

to other agents. Between the to absolutes are cardinal tournaments or relative piece-rates, a payment

structure including some elements of individual piece-rates and ordinal tournaments, i.e. consisting of a

base payment proportional to the absolute performance and a bonus or penalty depending on average

performance of all agents. All of the three schemes were extensively analyzed and compared at diﬀerent

times in the literature and in the next few paragraphs I will present a brief history of that analysis.

Before the prominent paper by Lazear and Rosen (1981), most of the focus was on analyzing simple

linear piece rate schemes (e.g., see Stiglitz (1975), Mirrlees (1976)), under which an agent receives com-

pensation as function of the output she produces, widely used in various contracts, examples here would

be a payment to salesman based on the sales he made, a payment to a worker on the plantation linearly

dependent on the amount of harvested crop. On the other hand, Lazear and Rosen (1981) and later

Holmstr¨om (1982), Green and Stokey (1983) and Nalebuﬀ and Stiglitz (1983) analyzed more intriguing

rank-order tournaments and compared them to other schemes to ﬁnd that under certain circumstances

the former can be superior to many others. Careful study of rank-order tournaments helps explain why

are those at the top of the pyramid (refering to CEOs mainly) are paid so much, why, when only best

three of Olympiad athletes are rewarded and others, sometimes being just one hundredths of a second

behind, get virtually nothing, so many people are eager to participate?

In their work Lazear and Rosen (1981) examined an ordinal tournament with two agents, both for the

case where agents were risk-neutral and the one where they were risk-averse. Authors show that when
the agents are riskneutral, there can be designed a tournament which will ensure the same allocation of

resources as an individual piece-rate. This equivalence vanishes when agents are assumed to be risk-averse:

depending on various parameters, tournament may or may not be superior in terms of allocation to piece

rate. Finally, the paper considers a case with heterogeneous workers, yielding some very diﬀerent results,

which are beyond the scope of this discussion. Lazear and Rosen, though, do not generalize results to

more than two players, and this issue is addressed in Malcomson (1986), where author solves a game for

the continuum of players and most recently in Akerlof and Holden (2012).

Holmstr¨om (1982) analyzed various relative compensation schemes, among which a rank-order tour-

naments. He considered production functions of two types, with multiplicative and additive shocks, and

many risk-averse agents. Holmstr¨om main ﬁnding is that ”rank-order tournaments may be information-

ally quite wasteful f performance levels can be measured cardinally rather than ordinally” (p.335).

Further investigation of the optimality of rank-order tournaments relative to individual compensation

schemes is oﬀered by Green and Stokey (1983). In their paper they have a setup very similar to Lazear

3

and Rosen (1981) and Holmstr¨om (1982), the main distinctive assumption made is that Green and Stokey

allow agents to observe private signals, correlated with this common shock,before they chose their eﬀort

levels” (p.3). Authors ﬁnd that rank-order tournament’s superiority in terms of allocation of resources

depends largely on the common shock structure and the number of agents in participating in the tourna-

ments: with a common error term or the number of agents being suﬃciently large, a tournament is able

to eliminate the major source of volatility in production.

Lately, most of the literature on tournaments is related to cardinal version of the scheme (e.g. Mari-

nakis and Tsoulouhas (2013)), i.e. a scheme under which an agent receives a base payment and a bonus

or penalty depending on the agent performance relative to the average performance of all agents in the

group, as this type of incentive payment scheme is argued by Holmstr¨om (1982) to be superior in terms
of use of information to the rank-order tournaments. As for ordinal tournaments, the interest of the

researches has shifted from pure theory towards empirical work based on experiments. In this regard,

Bull, Schotter, and Weigelt (1987) ﬁnd supportive evidence for the theory outlined in Lazear and Rosen

(1981).

In contrast with current research, this paper will be devoted to the analyses of rank-order tournaments

per se. I believe that this is the most spectacular of all compensation schemes as so many sports use it.

This paper was apparently developed parallel to the work of Akerlof and Holden (2012) and thus one of

the objectives of this research will be to generalize results of Lazear and Rosen to a contract for three

agents and a contract with N discretely distributed agents. As Bull, Schotter, and Weigelt (1987) mention

in their article ”a tournament, unlike the piece rate, is a game and so requires strategic, as opposed to

simply maximizing, behavior” (p. 3), I will use strategic approach in this paper. The main goal is to

see whether the results of Lazear and Rosen (1981) still hold, ones we abolish the assumption of perfect

competition and thus drop the zero-proﬁt constraint and increase the number of players to 3 or to N. Due

to this diﬀerence in assumptions, I will employ backward induction to solve the game and to ﬁnd optimal

value-maximizing prize structure explicitly in ordinal tournament. The main advantage of this work when

compared to Akerlof and Holden (2012) is that in their paper Akerlof and Holden try to solve very general

form of the problem which requires a lot of assumptions and do not provide exact prizes structure, while

this work explicitly ﬁnds the optimal prize structure for the tournament with 3 risk-neutral agents and

provides some insights for the 3 risk-averse.

The rest of the work is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a case of a contract between a risk-

neutral principal and 3 risk-neutral players, in Section 3 a more realistic situation is considered, i.e. players

are now assumed to be risk-averse, Section 4 presents an attempt to generalize a model to N agents and

describes some diﬃculties with that, ﬁnally, in Section 5 provides a review the work done and presents

conclusions.

2 The Rank-Order Tournament with 3 Risk-Neutral Agents

2.a Setup

In this paper only one period is under consideration, during this period a contract is signed between
a principal and 3 homogeneous agents. Under the contract agent i produces output xi according to the
production function (used by Marinakis and Tsoulouhas (2013)):

xi = ei + a + η + i

(1)

where a is agent’s ability, equal for all agents, ei is agent i’s eﬀort level, η is a common shock, η ∼ N (0, σ2
η),
and i is an idiosyncratic shock, i ∼ N (0, σ2
 ) iid. This production function diﬀers from that used by
Lazear and Rosen in two ways: the ability is separated from investment (eﬀort) and the risk is split into

common, aﬀecting all agents, for example, economics crisis, which is not diversiﬁable for the principal,

and speciﬁc risk to each agent, for example, sickness, which is diversiﬁable for the principal.

For simplicity of exposition, the price of the output is normalized to 1. Under the contract all of

the resulted revenue goes to the principal, while agents are compensated according to their ”rank”, i.e.

depending on the value of their output relative to that of other agents. Here and in all that follows I
assume that the principal is risk-neutral and acts as a value-maximizer. In this section agents are assumed

to be risk-neutral as well. I will use a utility function for an agent i that is separable in income and cost

of eﬀort, following absolute majority of papers on the topic:

u(wi, ei) = wi − e2
i
2a

(2)

where wi is a wage received by the agent i and e2
2a is a cost of eﬀort for the agent, decreasing in ability.
Under the ordinal tournament the wage rate (prize) received by the agent depends on the rank of xi, so
the precise structure of the compensation scheme for 3 agnets is as follows:

i



wi =

if xi > xj ∀i (cid:54)= j
if xi < xj ∀i (cid:54)= j
otherwise

W1

W3

W2

(3)

where W1 ≥ W2 ≥ W3 or, more speciﬁcally let W2 = αW1 + (1 − α)W3, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.

All the above information is available both to the principal and the agents. An interesting peculiarity

of the rank-order tournaments when compared to other incentive schemes like piece rates is that the

model can be viewed as a non-cooperative game: at stage 1 the principal designs a compensation scheme,
at stage 2 the agents are oﬀered this compensation scheme, if agents agree to sign a contract, then at

stage 3 they choose the level of investment (eﬀort) and at stage 4 the production happens and agents get

compensation. Because each agent chooses the level of eﬀort (investment) before the production takes

place and after, when the output is observed each agent receives her compensation, this model is similar

to Stackelberg leadership model with ﬁrst-mover advantage for the principal.

Therefore we will use backwards induction: ﬁrst the principal will calculate each agent’s eﬀort level

as a function of a prize structure, for this the principal needs to calculate the agent’s expected utility

ﬁrst, as the she knows that each agent will choose to sign a contract only if the expected payment gives

5

her maximum expected utility comparing to other oﬀers, i.e. the contract is incentive-compatible. At

the same time, the expected payment must also provide the agent with utility level at least equal to her

reservation utility (let us assume that it is the utility level an agent enjoys staying out of production), i.e.

satisfy individual rationality constraint. Finally, principal maximizes her total expected proﬁts subject to

the above incentive compatibility and individual rationality constraints.

The rest of the section will thus reﬂect the structure of the process of solving the game outlined above.

2.b Probabilities

The expected utility for the agent i is simply the expected wage less the cost of eﬀort:

EU = W1P (Rank First) + W2P (Rank Second) + W3P (Rank Third) − e2
i
2a

(4)

To ﬁnd EU we need to ﬁnd the probability of each payoﬀ, i.e.:

P (Rank First) = P1 = P (xi > xj and xi > xk)

Substituting each agent’s production function (1) into the above expression and rearranging further, we

get:

P1 = P (ei + a + η + i > ej + a + η + j and ei + a + η + i > ek + a + η + k) =

= P (ei + i > ej + j and ei + i > ek + k) =
= P (i − j < ei − ej and i − k < ei − ek)

As cov(i−j, i−k) = var(i) = σ2
and thus we can ﬁnd the probability of ranking ﬁrst as:

 (cid:54)= 0, random variables i−j and i−k have dependent distributions

P1 = Fi−j ,i−k (ei − ej, ei − ek) =

(cid:90) ei−ej

(cid:90) ei−ek

=

−∞

−∞

fi−j ,i−k (s, t)dsdt

(5)

where Fi−j ,i−k (.) is the joint cdf of ei − ej and ei − ek, fi−j ,i−k (.) is its joint pdf. By analogy, the
probability of ranking third out of three agents is:

P (Rank Third) = P3 = P (xi < xj and xi < xk) =

(cid:90) ∞

(cid:90) ∞

=

ei−ej

ei−ek

fi−j ,i−k (s, t)dsdt

So probability of receiving W2, in other words, raking second can be found as:

P (Rank Second) = P2 = 1 − P1 − P3

2.c

Incentive Compatibility

After calculating the probabilities of each outcome, we can now substitute the expressions (5), (6) and

(7) into the expected utility for agent i (4) to get:

EU = W1P1 + W2(1 − P1 − P3) + W3P3 − e2
i
2a

(8)

The principal want to ﬁnd the level of eﬀort that the agent will choose treating prize speciﬁcation as
given, so she maximizes the agent’s expected utility (8) with respect to ei. First order condition is:

If the Cournot-Nash assumptions are satisﬁed, as every agent has symmetric reaction function, then
in equilibrium each agent will choose the same optimal level of eﬀort ex-ante, meaning that ei = ej =
ek = e∗ in equilibrium and thus ex-post probabilities of ranking ﬁrst, second and third will be equal
P1 = P2 = P3 = 1

It is important to stress here that the above result will only hold for symmetric distributions with

mean 0. This topic is further explored in great detail in Akerlof and Holden (2012).

By analogy with (12), in equillibrium ∂P3
∂ei

= −g(0), so ∂P1

∂ei

+ ∂P3
∂ei

= 0. It will be worth noting, that

this result will hold in a more general form for symmetric distributions with mean 0:

if the number of

agents will be even, 2k, then for all pairs of marginal probabilities for i from 1 to 2k the following will hold
∂Pi
∂ei
to eﬀort of getting exactly in the middle, i.e. ranking k + 1, will be zero as in the case with 3 agents.

= 0, in case the number of agents will be odd, 2k + 1, marginal probability with respect

+ ∂Pi+2k−1

∂ei

Substituting the above equilibrium conditions (12) and (14) into (9), we get the optimal eﬀort as

function of W1 and W3:

(W1 − W3)

(IC.1)

What this says is that when choosing an eﬀort level to apply, the agent only considers the spread
between the ﬁrst and the last prize! Intermediate prize, W2, doesn’t appear in the optimal eﬀort function
at all. So when agents are risk neutral, the principal can elicit higher eﬀort by increasing the spread

between the ﬁrst and the third price. This is by far the most interesting result of the paper, it is

consistent with the ﬁnding of Lazear and Rosen (1981) for the two agents, although, this paper has used

entirely diﬀerent approach and did not restrict itself to the case of principal facing perfect competition in

the market.

This result is far more intriguing though than the same one for two agents. And this is why: Lazear
and Rosen found that the spread between W1 and W2 mattered for two agents engaging in the production,
so all prized in the compensation scheme matter, but what this paper ﬁnds is that with greater number

of contestants, three, not all of the prizes matter for the decision on how hard to work! The intuition

might be as follows: when working at the large corporation you always think of the CEO’s compensation

as compared to yours, this diﬀerence is exactly the thing that motivates you to apply best eﬀort in the

whole course of you career.

2.d Individual Rationality

Principal knows that at the same time as being incentive-compatible, the expected prize must also

translate into the expected utility at least equal to the agent’s reservation utility u, or the agent will

8

simply choose not to work, in other words it has to satisfy individual rationality constraint:

EU ≥ u

Following Marinakis and Tsoulouhas (2013), I further assume that the principal has all the bargaining

power and wants to insure participation at the least costs, so the agent is left with no rents and individual

rationality constraint holds with an equality:

EU = u ⇔

W1P1 + W2P2 + W3P3 − e2
i
2a

= u

(15)

Substituting e∗ from (IC.1) and equilibrium probabilities, further rearranging, we get an expression for

2.e Proﬁt Maximization

Finally, at stage 1 of the game, the principal maximizes her total expected proﬁt subject to incentive

compatibility (IC.1) and individual rationality (IR.1) constrains to ﬁnd the prize structure that will ensure

both participation and required level of eﬀort from the agent and maximum proﬁt for the principal:

2.f Solutions

This subsection will be devoted to ﬁnding the closed form solutions for the prizes. Any precise solutions

for speciﬁc functions are entirely absent in Lazear and Rosen (1981) and others, including Akerlof and

Holden (2012), because the researches tend to solve most general models, do not specify any distribution

for individual utility and cost of eﬀort functions, often use approximations and simulations, while this

paper has an advantage of showing and analyzing results explicitly using concrete functional forms for

the utility and cost of eﬀort.

Substituting the spread into (IC.1) we get optimal eﬀort:

(18)

This is a new result, that apparently can be attributed to this paper: when agents are risk-neutral and

homogeneous, the optimal level of eﬀort for each agent is equal to her ability.

Substituting W1 − W3 from (17) back into (IR.1), we get a relationship between W1 and W2:

Summing (19), (20) and (21), we ﬁnd that the total payment principal makes to agents is independent
of α, it does not matter neither for the agents nor for the principal whether W2 is set equal to W1 or W3. If
the principal set α = 0, the resulted prizes would be W1 = 4

We can see that each prize includes a base payment, consisting of agent’s reservation utility and some

compensation for the eﬀort (equal to ability), and a ”fee” increasing in volatility of production. This

results is exactly the one described by Lazear and Rosen (1981), so we can conclude that their ﬁndings

are robust to the drop of zero-proﬁt assumption.

Summarizing the ﬁndings of this section, we see that in the game with three homogeneous risk-neutral

agents, all agents choose to apply the same eﬀort, only taking into account the spread between the ﬁrst

and the last price, this optimal eﬀorts turns out to be equal the agent’s ability. The setting does not allow

to identify the unique structure of the prizes, but a continuum of such structures. Taking one numerical

example we saw, that in this kind of game the optimal compensation can be viewed as consisting of the

basic payment and a bonus or penalty depending on the rank, which reminds as of the cardinal tournament

compensation scheme.

3 The Rank-Order Tournament with 3 Risk-Averse Agents

3.a Setup

In this section quite unrealistic assumption that agents are rick-neutral is revised and instead agents

are assumed to be risk-averse. For the analysis of this case a widely used in literature (e.g. in Lazear and

Rosen (1981), Marinakis and Tsoulouhas (2013)), so called CARA utility function, function that posses

constant absolute risk aversion, is chosen, so the utility for agent i is now:

(cid:18)

−r

(cid:19)(cid:19)

(cid:18)
wi − e2
i
2a

(23)

u(wi, ei) = −exp

The rest of the setup duplicates that of 2.a.

3.b Probabilities

This section does not change from 2.b, as the only modiﬁed assumption is the utility function and the

form of the utility function does not aﬀect probabilities, so P1, P2 and P3 are identical to 2.b.

3.c

Incentive Compatibility

Just as in case with risk-neutral players, the principal needs to ﬁnd the expected utility for agent i,

which is a little more complicated now:

(IC.2)

This incentive-compatibility constraint tells us that, in contrast with a case of risk-neutral agents, the

intermediate prize now does matter for the risk-averse agent when she chooses how hard to work her whole

life. Again, despite the diﬀerent approaches, this result is consistent with analysis for just two agents in
Lazear and Rosen (1981). This result in itself is important because, although Lazear and Rosen (1981)

ﬁnd that for two risk-averse agents it is the wages themselves, not the spread matter, it was not clear

whether the second prize would have inﬂuence on agent’s decision for 3 agents or not. This paper ﬁnds

13

that it does. The intuition behind it may be that under risk-aversion, the expected payment is not equal

to the expected utility of that payment and agents prefer a more certain income.

3.d Individual Rationality

As in the case with risk-neutral players, compensation scheme must satisfy individual rationality

constraint, i.e. result in the expected utility no less than agent’s reservation utility:

EU ≥ u

Again, I assume that the principal has all the bargaining power and wants to insure participation at the

least costs, so the agent is left with no rents and individual rationality constraint holds with an equality:

As shown in the Appendix 2, there is no closed-form explicit solution for the proﬁt maximization

problem for the case with 3 risk-averse agents.

3.f Results

Although the case when the principal signs a contract with three risk-averse agents, instead of risk-

neutral, does not have an explicit solution for the chosen utility function and for the simpler one (see

14

Appendix 1), we can gain some insights by using advanced optimization techniques that will give as
approximate optimal values of W1, W2 and W3, for diﬀerent values of parameters we get the results
presented in Table 1.

Ability (a) Risk-Aversion (r) W1

Everywhere in the Table 1 u = −1, starting values for W1, W2 and W3 are [100 100 100].

Table 1 shows an interesting result: for diﬀerent values of ability, risk-aversion and production volatility,

coming from idiosyncratic risks, prize for the ﬁrst place is always positive, but the prizes for second and

third are actually negative, usually an agents pays a greater sum for not winning and even greater for

loosing, than the sum she gets for winning the tournament!

To summarize, there are two main learnings from the work on this section. The ﬁrst one is that when
agents are averse towards risk, their choice of the optimal level of eﬀort does depend on all the prizes W1,
W2 and W3, not just the spread between the ﬁrst and the last prize. This does not contradict Lazear and
Rosen (1981). And the second is that optimal wages structure suggest that winner gets positive prize,

while looser have to pay for their loss.

4 The Rank-Order Tournament with N Risk-Neutral Agents

4.a Setup

In their prominent paper Lazear and Rosen (1981) describe a tournament for just 2 players, while

this paper went further and attempted to analyze ordinal tournament with 3 contestants, main challenge

was to conﬁrm ﬁndings for 2-3 players taking N agents. Malcomson (1986) took the case of a continuum

of agents to compare piece rates and rank-order tournaments, but focused on the performance of agents

not being public information aﬀecting the relative optimum of the two schemes. Just lately, Akerlof

and Holden (2012) performed an extensive analysis of this case, though not providing a wage structure

speciﬁcally. This section attempts to do a similar analysis, assuming though that agents are discrete, and

describes diﬃculties that arise. So taking a simpler case with risk-neutral players, the setup here is the

same as in 2.a, but the number of agents is N.

Under the ordinal tournament the wage received by the agent i depends on the rank of xi:



W1

W2
...
Wn

if xi > xj ∀i (cid:54)= j

if xi < xj ∀i (cid:54)= j

(27)

wi =

where W1 ≥ W2 ≥ ... ≥ Wn.

4.b Probabilities

The principal wants to ﬁnd the the expected utility and maximize it to ﬁnd the eﬀort level that the

agent i will chooses.

EU = W1P1 + W2P2 + ... + WnPn − e2
i
2a

=

(28)

n(cid:88)

s=1

=

WsPs − e2
i
2a

To calculate the expected utility for the agent i we need the probability of each payoﬀ:

P (Rank First) = P1 = P (xi > xj and xi > xk and xi > xf , etc)

...

P (Rank N) = Pn = P (xi < xj and xi < xk and xi < xf , etc)

16

Unfortunately, there exist no compact representations for this probabilities:

P1 = Fi−j ,...,i−k (ei − ej, . . . , ei − ek) =

(cid:90) ei−ej
(cid:124)

−∞

(cid:90) ei−ek

−∞

. . .

(cid:123)(cid:122)

n times

=

fi−j ,...,i−k (s, . . . , t)ds, . . . , dt

Obviously, probabilities must sum up to 1:

P1 + P2 + ... + Pn = 1 ⇒

n(cid:88)

Ps = 1

Taking full diﬀerential of (30) wrt ei, we get:

s=1

∂P1
∂ei

+

+ ... +

= 0 ⇒

∂Pn
∂ei

∂P2
∂ei

n(cid:88)

s=1

∂Ps
∂ei

= 0

(29)

(30)

(31)

As discussed in more detail in 2.c, the relationship among these marginal probabilities is as follows

depends on symmetry on the underlying distribution and whether the number of agents is odd or even.

4.c

Incentive Compatibility

To ensure that the compensation scheme is incentive-compatible, the principal maximizes expected

utility of each agent (28) with respect to eﬀort level ei. First order condition is:

∂EU
∂ei

= 0 ⇔

W1

∂P1
∂ei

+ W2

∂P2
∂ei

+ ... + Wn

∂Pn
∂ei

− ei
a

= 0

(32)

If the Cournot-Nash assumptions are satisﬁed, then ei = ej = ek = e∗ in equilibrium and thus ex-post
probabilities are equal in equilibrium, i.e. P1 = P2 = ... = Pn = 1
n .

With N players, we can not explicitly derive values of marginal probabilities in a form we derived then

in 2.c, nor can we understand the relationship between them beyond the point already mentioned. This

is the main obstacle on our way in this section. We can not conclude whether optimal eﬀort depends only

on the spread between the ﬁrst and the last prize, or on each prize in the scheme:

e∗ = a(W1

∂P1
∂ei

+ W2

∂P2
∂ei

+ ... + Wn

∂Pn
∂ei

)

(IC.3)

4.d Individual Rationality

To satisfy individual rationality constraint, the principal also needs to take into account that the

optimal compensation scheme must ensure expected utility (28) at least equal to agent’s reservation

17

utility u:

EU ≥ u

Once again, I assume that the principal has all the bargaining power and wants to insure participation

at the least costs, so the agent is left with no rents and individual rationality constraint holds with an

equality:

EU = u

⇔

WsPs − e2
i
2a

n(cid:88)

(33)

Substituting equilibrium conditions and e∗ from (IC.3), we get the following expression:

4.e Proﬁt Maximization

The principal’s expected proﬁt is again:

EΠ = Exi + . . . + Exk − n(cid:88)
= n(e∗ + a) − n(cid:88)

s=1

Ws

s=1

Ws =

(34)

Substituting e∗ from (IC.3) and(cid:80)n

s=1 Ws from (IR.3), the expression for expected proﬁt becomes:

EΠ = na(W1

∂P1
∂ei

+ W2

(35)

Maximization of total expected proﬁt (35) with respect to a set of wages W1,. . .,Wn does not help us
determine the optimal compensation scheme.

4.f Results

The objective of this section was to see whether a striking result that risk-neutral players take into

account only the spread between the ﬁrst and the last prize that was discovered by Lazear and Rosen

(1981) for the game with two players and conﬁrmed for the one with three in 2.c of this paper, will hold

for more general setting with N agents. It appears from the above analyzes that the answer is not clear

and depends on the relationship between the marginal probabilities.

18

5 Conclusions

This paper was based mainly on the famous work of Lazear and Rosen (1981), that eﬀectively es-
tablished the theory of rank-order tournaments. It was developed in parallel with more recent work of

Akerlof and Holden (2012), though having slightly diﬀerent objectives.

Lazear and Rosen started their article by stating that: ”It is a familiar proposition that under com-

petitive conditions workers are paid the value of their marginal products.” So the assumption of perfect

competition is vital to their work. What this research had as its purpose was relaxing the assumption of

perfect competition and letting the principal enjoy economic proﬁts. This led to view of the tournament

as a non-cooperative game and required choosing backwards induction as the method for solving it. In

this regard the main ﬁnding is that imposition of a perfect competition in the market for the agent’s

output was not crucial to the validity of results: all of the ﬁndings are consistent with a view of Lazear

and Rosen (1981).

Another objective of this research was obtaining closed-form solutions for the prize-structure using

speciﬁc utility and cost of eﬀort functions for the agents, instead of the general form and Taylor approxi-

mations used in the original paper. It turned out that it was only possible to so for the case with three

risk-neutral agents, found solutions provide some further insights into the theory of tournaments and will

be discussed in more detail below.

Next area for this research was proving that results that were shown by Lazear and Rosen (1981) for

the contract with two risk-neutral agents would hold for three. The ﬁnding that in the ordinal tournament

with two risk-neutral players when choosing the optimum level of eﬀort agents only take into consideration

the spread between the ﬁrst and the last prize is conﬁrmed in this paper for the game with three risk-

neutral agents and relaxed zero-proﬁt assumption inherent to the analysis of Lazear and Rosen (1981)

and some of their followers. This ﬁnding is important because Lazear and Rosen basically stated that

when there two prizes, the spread between them matter, but what if there were more prizes? Would it be

spreads between successive prizes that matters? For three players it appear that only the spread between

the ﬁrst and last one matters. Moreover, another result that deserves attention and seems unique to this

paper and was not possible to notice in Lazear and Rosen (1981), because the production function in

their research did not include ability of the agent, is that the agent chooses the optimal eﬀort level simply

equal to her ability.

Although it was not possible to ﬁnd an explicit solution to the game with three risk-averse agents,
the main result of the case when agents care for risks is that the optimum level of eﬀort they choose now

deﬁnitely depends on all the prizes values, not just the spread between ﬁrst and the last one as in the

case with risk-neutral agents. This is again in line with analysis by Lazear and Rosen (1981).

The last goal of this work was to see whether a striking result that risk-neutral players take into

account only the spread between the ﬁrst and the last prize that was discovered by Lazear and Rosen

(1981) for the game with two players and conﬁrmed for the one with three in 2.c of this paper, will hold

for more general setting with N agents. It appears from the above analyzes that the answer is not clear

and depends on the relationship between the marginal probabilities.

Summarizing it all, this paper conﬁrmed most of the results of Lazear and Rosen (1981) it chose for

exploring along with ﬁnding some new and facing obstacles not mentioned in the original paper, but also

described in detail on Akerlof and Holden (2012).

So, from (39) we can clearly see that we will not be able to present an analytical solution for the optimal

eﬀort and thus it was decided not to proceed with this speciﬁcation.

Thus we have a system on three non-linear equations with parameters (A.1), (A.2) and (A.3), for which it

is impossible to ﬁnd an analytical solution, so the solution is to choose reasonable values for the parameters

and use advanced optimization methods in Matlab to gain insights into the relationship between optimal
values of W1, W2 and W3.
