Introduction 

In this paper I am focusing on research of stress-testing of banks from the perspective of 
investors. I am studying the payoffs for investors depending on their degree of risk-aversion 
and expectations about the state of economy for 10 large US banks and try to find the optimal 
choice for each type of investor.  

The choice of topic for my research has been quite easy for me for several reasons. To begin 
with, each financial crisis shows again and again that all existing stress-testing capabilities 
fail to provide banks and other financial institutions with a proper protection against severe 
macroeconomic environment. We observed it in 1998, when the world known fund – LTCM 
– run by Nobel Prize winners collapsed in a moment. We observed this again when the 
dotcom bubble led to catastrophic losses in 1999-2000. The crisis was preceded by a lot of 
statements of well-known people from banks and even regulators that all was going fine. 
What we could expect is that following such events, financial institutions would enhance 
their stress-testing capabilities and as a result limit their losses in the next adverse scenario 
which of course would happen sooner or later. Or at least that these institutions would 
forecast such a scenario and prepare some contingency plan including cutting risk exposures 
within a certain period preceding the crisis. Obviously, what happened in 2008, didn’t meet 
such expectations. Once again, banks were hit by severe losses, and many institutions even 
from the top world banks had to be bailed out (we all remember the collapse of Lehman 
Brothers, but it is important to note that almost all other large banks were also on the brink of 
announcing defaults and received huge capital inflows from governments – both in the 
United States, and in Europe. The cause of all the crises mentioned above were different: 
sovereign defaults of developing countries, price bubble in a certain industry, 
mismanagement of a certain type of risk (credit risk if we are speaking about 2008 crisis). 
What is common behind all these cases? Investors of banks experienced sharp losses, and 
banks’ and regulators’ stress-testing capabilities failed to catch these scenarios and get those 
institutions ready.  

In this paper I am attempting to define an approach that will enable investors to choose the 
optimal bank for holding shares in based on the historical performance (both during crises 
and normal economic environment) and their financial position (probability of falling below 
regulatory requirements for capital adequacy). My goal is to find an optimal choice for 
different types of investors (based on their macroeconomic expectations and risk-aversion).

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the literature and 
research related to the topic of this paper. Section 3 describes the theoretical framework of 
this research. Section 4 provides the step-by-step numerical outcomes of the model as well as 
the key conclusions. Section 5 describes limitations to the model and potential for further 
research. Section 6 concludes the paper. 

Literature overview 

When I started to look into the topic, I immediately found a lot of research that was related to 
stress-testing. This topic started to gain popularity in the end of 1990s with the development 
of advanced computers which enabled to produce computationally heavy models that could 
not have been used previously. As a result, there was a huge wave of researchers (both in 
Universities, financial companies, and regulators) that started to generate scenario modelling 
frameworks trying to produce the most accurate estimates of various parameters. 

All stress testing exercises are mostly focused on loss forecasting or forecasting capital 
adequacy. Another type of stress testing is about tests on the whole financial system, which is 
becoming now more and more popular with regulators – the Federal Reserve produced such 
an exercise in 2009, Bank of Spain recently finished its assessment of the capital adequacy of 
the Spain banking system, currently the ECB is carrying out such an exercise to define the 
need of the European financial system for capital injections. These types of models are 
covered in Sorge M. (2004). In this paper the author provides a description of the macro 
stress-testing frameworks which he splits into two broad types: “piecewise approach” (which 
in other words means that the stress-testing model examines how a single parameter can 
impact the financial system) and “integrated approach” (this is about how sensitive the 
financial system is to a group of parameters simultaneously). This paper gives quite a 

comprehensive vision of the existing approaches, their strong and weak points, and 
summarizes that significant progress has been achieved in stress-testing techniques in terms 
of econometric modeling. In addition, the paper highlights the issues that are perceived by 
the author as key challenges to stress-testing frameworks: 

1)  Risk correlations (both across various banks and across different time periods) – 

measurement of this still remains quite ambiguous 

2)  Short time periods that are used for parameterization of stress-testing models – this 

decreases the model predictive power as well as fails to catch some of the effects that 
may follow longer economic cycles. However, this still remains an issue as low data 
availability (particularly for less developed markets and smaller companies) prevents 
researchers from developing more comprehensive models 

3)  Correct accounting for feedback effect – due to this phenomenon, all reduced-form 

parameter estimates may be unstable 

Compared to the paper described above, this paper tends more towards micro-prudential 
stress-testing, so issues 1) and 3) are not that relevant for this research. Short time horizon is 
on the other hand an issue. In terms of the approach applied, this paper focuses on “integrated 
approach” if we stick for now to Sorge’s terminology – effects on banks’ parameters are 
estimated from the simultaneous impact of several external variables. 

Another paper that covers stress-testing frameworks quite broadly is Blasche W., Jones M. 
T., Majnoni G., Peria S. M. (2001). This paper is structured around four essential areas: 
general review of basic stress-testing models, discussion of “conceptual issues” that arise 
when looking at the system-wide risks assessment, description of the core stress-testing 
toolbox, and FSAP analysis.  

Among the issues identified by the authors of the paper, are the following: 

1)  Scope definition – this issue is not as crucial for individual bank stress testing. In macro-

prudential stress-testing the authors state that there are problems in choosing the set of 
financial institutions to be included in the research (e.g. only banks, or also insurance 

companies, asset management companies, hedge funds etc., should there be any 
thresholds by total assets / revenues, and so on). Another issue here is about taking into 
account multinational institutions – how local macroeconomic shocks will be linked to 
international shocks and if there is going to be any support for domestic subsidiaries from 
foreign banks / parent companies. In my research I do not include some of large US 
banks for this exact reason – this would require to incorporate quite ambiguous and often 
expert based judgments concerning support from the Group. This is why I do not include 
for example HSBC North America Holdings in the research sample 

2)  Another issue outlined in the paper is about aggregation approaches. On the one hand, 
conducting system-wide tests by gathering stress-test results from individual banks and 
then aggregating those requires very sophisticated risk management capabilities from 
banks themselves (to take into account all interlinkages in the economy accurately), and 
is hardly a viable option even in developed economies. On the other hand, if the regulator 
collects portfolio data from individual banks and then runs stress test itself, there are still 
significant requirements for the quality of these data and the level of their granularity for 
the model to reflect all the peculiarities of various business lines. This issue is not 
actually crucial for my research, as it only matters for stress-testing of a banking system, 
whereas this paper focuses on stress-testing of individual institutions. 

Among the early papers on the topic I would also like to mention Berkowitz J. (1999). 
The focus of this paper is about mixing stress-testing models with internal risk 
assessment models (e.g. portfolio VaR1 models). The author argues that putting stress-
testing outside risk models – which means that stress scenarios are generated without 
links to risk models – makes stress-test results much less valid and decreases the degree 
of responsibility of those who calibrate the stress-testing models. The reason for this is 
that defining the stress scenario parameters tends to be quite subjective, and if scenarios 
are set outside risk models, there is no probability assigned to them. If instead they are set 
within risk models, this helps produce a loss distribution for the bank, which is easier to 
validate and imposes more responsibility on the risk managers who generate those

scenarios. In my work I do not touch this issue; however, I do build a distribution of 
payoffs based on various scenarios. The difference is that I use the same unified 
assumption for all banks in the sample. 

Another paper related to the stress-testing frameworks is about Finnish credit risk 
assessment. Again, as we can observe, stress-testing is mainly applied to evaluate losses 
under certain scenarios. Virolainen K. (2004)” covers credit risks of Finland corporates. 
The core idea of the paper is to estimate dependencies between industry-specific default 
rates and macroeconomic variables. The author finds out that there is significant 
relationship between corporate default probabilities and several macroeconomic 
parameters, among which he names GDP, interest rates, and corporate indebtedness. As a 
next step, Virolainen uses the obtained relationships in order to evaluate the risks of 
Finnish banks with regards to corporates and comes to the conclusion that these are not at 
all critical (at the point of publishing the paper).  

In my research I follow partially this approach in terms of starting with defining 
relationships between bank-specific parameters and macroeconomic variables which is 
then followed by using these relationships to estimate parameter values under different 
scenarios. This approach is generally at the core of stress testing, and more recently 
researchers have started to apply more sophisticated and mathematically advanced 
procedures for modeling, but the degree of advancement doesn’t necessarily imply better 
accuracy. Coming back to comparing my research with Virolainen, I do not limit my 
research to corporates or retail and do not look explicitly at various industries. In 
addition, my target metric is investor payoff for each bank, and not the credit risk loss as 
in the case with the paper described above. 

Another paper that is worth noting here is Hoggarth G., Sorensen S. & Zicchino L. 
(2005).  This paper is in fact among the pioneers of the multivariate analysis on how 
write-offs are defined by macro economy “both in aggregate and at sectoral level”. The 
paper is about the effects of macroeconomic variables on the write-off-to-loan ratio 
which the researchers treat as a measure of realized losses of a bank. The key findings are 
that GDP fluctuations have a significant effect on overall and corporate ratios, whereas 

retail ones are more exposed to household income and indebtedness changes. The 
methodology applied also takes into account feedback effects from banking sector 
parameters to macroeconomic ones.  

This paper is different to my research in the sense that they focus purely on realized 
losses (again, stress-testing focus is on losses), while I am looking at a composite view of 
profitability and capital position. In addition to this, I take into account the aggregate 
impact of macroeconomic variables, but not the feedback effect from the banking system. 
This is mainly due to the fact that I am running stress tests on individual institutions, and 
feedback effects are best captured when running a model on the financial system as a 
whole. 

Among more recent publications, I would like to say a few words about Hirtle B., Kovner 
A., Vickery J. & Bhanot M. (2014). In this paper discussion is built around CLASS 
model (Capital and Loss Assessment under Stress Scenarios). The model uses regressions 
on the banks’ Balance and P&L items to arrive at the capital adequacy projections under 
various scenarios, and the final result is the capital gap – how much capital is required in 
order to bring all banks in the system to the required threshold. 

This is similar to my approach in the way that I also estimate separate models for bank 
parameters, but I focus on individual institutions and investor payoff instead of system-
wide capital adequacy. 

Another related paper is Duane M., Schuermann T. & Reynolds P. (2013). The authors 
focus on stress testing income statements of banks and state that it is crucial for an 
accurate stress testing procedure to ensure the deepest level of granularity in modeling. In 
my research I include profitability metric (ROE) into the framework, but remain at the 1st 
level of granularity (bank as a whole), which is one of the directions for upgrading the 
model. 

 

 

Model overview 

Payoff function derivation 

 

3. 

3.1. 
 

As I have already mentioned in the literature overview, stress-testing exercise is most 
often used to evaluate the exposure of an institution or a system of institutions to a certain 
type of risk. As a result, the researchers obtain the probabilities of default, or potential 
losses from a predefined scenario / set of scenarios. Regulators often look at the capital 
assessment side – how much capital may be required for the system to remain stable 
under a determined probability (or again predefined scenarios). The majority of stress 
tests are looking at the outcomes from the perspective of the institution or from the 
perspective of the regulators. Instead, I am looking at stress-testing from the perspective 
of the investors of the institution in question. After all, the ultimate goal of an institution 
(private one) is to maximize shareholder value, and this is exactly the point of view that 
is applied in my paper for applying stress-testing exercise. This is why, in my paper I am 
talking about investor payoff. 

So, what do we perceive as investor payoff? Some naïve answer would probably go for 
dividends and capital gains derived from the increase in market price of the company 
stock. However, there are several issues if we are looking at these components from the 
stress-testing position.  

Let us start with dividends. One would argue that there should be a significant 
dependence of dividends on the state of economy (in crises dividends are certainly 
lower). I would put it in a different way saying that dividends depend on two key things: 
company profits and the policy of the company management. The latter is hard to 
measure explicitly given that even with the same people perceptions of the optimal ways 
for business development may change over time and management itself often changes, 
which makes any model trying to parameterize this quite unreliable. The first component 

– profit fluctuations – does depend on the macroeconomic situation and of course cannot 
be ignored under the stress-testing.  

Turning to the second component of our naïve payoff, here I would split the gains (or 
losses in bad times) experienced by shareholders into two parts: changes in company 
fundamentals, mainly, its profitability and risks, and overall market fluctuations, that are 
often very much based not on the company / economy fundamentals, but rather on more 
random and behavioral patterns among traders.   

What we see here is that we definitely need to base the payoff function on the company 
fundamentals thus eliminating side effects of traders’ irrational behavior, overall market 
swings, policy of a company’s management etc. This is why I have defined the following 
payoff function for an investor of bank j: 

1,𝑖𝑓 𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗𝑡<4%
1,𝑖𝑓 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗𝑡<8%
2+𝑅𝑂𝐸𝑗𝑡,𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒

�

 

Where: 

𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗𝑡 is the Tier 1 capital ratio of Bank j at time period t (tier 1 capital over risk-

weighted assets), which is one of the main requirements by regulators these days – the 
ratio must exceed a certain threshold (4% for Basel II, and for Basel III things are 
becoming more complicated with introduction of various buffers, so I am not going to 
start this discussion in this paper)2 

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗𝑡 is the total capital ratio of Bank j at time period t (total capital 

divided by risk-weighted assets) which is another regulatory metric. The key point here is 
that the breach of these limits leads to a revocation of banking license from the institution 
that has breached them. In this case, I assume that investors lose all their investment (this 
is simplified approach, not taking into account possible proceeds from bankruptcy) 

                                                      
2 For a discussion of Basel III capital rules please refer to the official guidelines by BIS (http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf) 

𝑅𝑂𝐸𝑗𝑡  - ROE (return on equity) of Bank j at time period t. This is the core metric for an 

investor as it says directly how much profit the Bank has generated with each invested 
dollar.  

As you may have noticed, the lower bound of the payoff function is 1. The reason is 
purely mathematical – for further analysis of risk-aversion, I raise the payoff to different 
powers, and this may yield ambiguous and incorrect results if payoffs are less than one in 
absolute values or if they are negative. In addition, ROE downside is limited to -1 (-
100%): you cannot lose more than you have invested; this is what all this limited liability 
is about. 

Another reason not to take into account market information is that it is forward looking, 
thus it reflects somehow investor expectations. There are two issues with this fact. The 
first is that expectations are not necessarily rational, thus market prices may not 
objectively reflect company value at any given point in time, and as I have mentioned 
before, I am looking at stress-testing from the perspective of shareholder value. Another 
issue is that I take into account investor expectations further in the model, so I would like 
to avoid accounting for expectations twice as this may produce certain bias in the model 
estimates. 

Accounting for investor expectations and risk-aversion 

Now when the payoffs have been calculated for each bank, it is important to say that 
investors differ with respect to their degree of risk-aversion and their expectations about 
the future. In my research I am looking at both these differences.  

As far as expectations are concerned, I divide all investors into 20 groups, each expecting 
some 5% of macroeconomic scenarios. This means that there are investors expecting 5% 
worst scenarios, investors that expect the economy to be between 10% and 5% worst 
scenarios etc. For the purposes of this analysis I assume that all investors are risk-neutral. 
Then I estimate the expected payoffs in each bucket of scenarios and look at what banks 
are the leaders and outsiders under each set of macroeconomic expectations. 

3.2. 
 

For the risk-aversion, I include it as a power applied to the payoff function. If an investor 
is risk-averse, he will always prefer “point in the middle” to endpoints, which 
corresponds to the utility function of the form  

𝑈𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘−𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒=𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝛼,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 0<𝛼<1 

This is why I chose to design the payoff function which always exceeds 1. I choose 

different values of the risk-aversion parameter 𝛼 (up to 0.001) and look at how the 

investor choices change with the degree of risk-aversion. 

A similar approach is applied to risk-lovers. Their utility function corresponds to the one 
of the form: 

𝑈𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘−𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟=𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝛼,𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝛼>1 

Here I choose values of risk-aversion parameter 𝛼 (up to 900, above this it produces 

computational errors) and again look at how investor choices alter with the increase of 
risk appetite. 

Scenario modeling 

3.3. 
3.3.1.  Overall approach 
 

From all the above it has now become evident that scenario modeling is required to 
produce the desired outcomes. In scenario modeling there are generally several 
approaches, including historical scenarios, expert-based scenarios, and multiple scenario 
simulation. I go with the latter option, and here I explain why.  

The recent crises have shown that adverse scenarios are often generated by 
macroeconomic phenomena that have not been observed before – dotcoms, subprime 
derivatives, etc. This implies that simply taking a historical crisis scenario may not 
capture all the significant risks to an institution. 

As for an expert-based scenario, the name of this approach speaks for itself. Scenario 
choice may be quite subjective and not fully reflect the potential downside to an 
institution. In addition, even if it does, this approach doesn’t work for comparing 
institutions – a severe scenario for one bank may be quite non-problematic for another. 
For a proper comparison I need the whole set of scenarios that contain “hard” and “easy” 
ones for each institution. That is why I choose Monte-Carlo simulation – it allows 
looking at all combinations of possible macroeconomic fluctuations irrespective of 
whether they happened in the past or not and irrespective of expert judgment, which 
eliminates possible bias. 

3.3.2.  Macroeconomic variables 
3.3.2.1. 

Variable choice 

 

When choosing macroeconomic variables, there are two aspects that I consider: 
econometrical and economic.  From the economic point of view, I take the metrics that 
can be seen as describing the overall state of economy and that are representative of 
crises / booms. This is how the long list of macroeconomic variables is compiled. From 
the econometric point of view, I try to eliminate multicollinearity from the models, so I 
look at the correlation matrix of the long list of macroeconomic variables. Here the 
approach is much expert-based – I do not define a numerical criterion for eliminating 
variables from the list. I look at the similar variables that are highly correlated and try to 
choose the one that has least correlations (by absolute value of course) with other 
variables. The one not chosen is eliminated. This generates the final list of variables to be 
used in regressions. However, even if some multicollinearity is present, it leads to less 
significant coefficients, and this I try to avoid when choosing the optimal model. 

3.3.2.2. 

Generating uncorrelated shocks 

 

Each scenario is in essence a combination of values of macroeconomic variables. Here 
we face several issues. Firstly, we need to choose a wide set of macroeconomic variables 

which provides a fine description of the state of economy. This is described above. 
Secondly, we need to decide how scenarios are generated. For this purpose, I employ a 
multistep procedure. On the 1st step I estimate the mean and variance for each 
macroeconomic variable that is included in scenarios. I use simple historic mean and 
variance: 

Where 𝑋� is the sample mean of macroeconomic variable X; T is the total number of 

periods in the sample. This is just the sample mean formula.  

Parameter variance is given by: 

Where 𝜎𝑋𝑖2  is the sample variance of macroeconomic variable𝑋𝑖𝑡. This formula is just the 

sample variance formula, so there is no sense in elaborating on this topic any more. 

After mean and variance for each macroeconomic variable are estimated, I make an 
assumption that all macroeconomic variables are distributed normally: 

𝑋𝑡

 

𝑋�=∑

𝑇𝑡=1𝑇

𝜎𝑋𝑖2=∑ (𝑋𝑡−𝑋�)2
𝑇𝑡=1𝑇−1

 

𝑋𝑖𝑡~𝑁(𝑋�𝑖,𝜎𝑋𝑖2) 

 

𝑋𝑖𝑡𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑=𝑋𝑖𝑡−𝑋�𝑖
𝜎𝑋𝑖 
{𝑋1𝑡,𝑋2𝑡,…,𝑋𝑛𝑡} 

This is a strong assumption, but it is required for the purposes of further analysis. When 
generating scenarios, I first generate random deviations of all factors as if they were 
independent. For simplicity and for comparability purposes I generate random deviations 
for the normalized factors: 

So, in each scenario I obtain a vector of normalized macroeconomic variables: 

Where 𝑋1𝑡 is the value of a random deviation of macroeconomic variable i. 

Generating correlated shocks 

3.3.2.3. 

 

However, it is obvious that these variables are far from independent. Thus we need to 
take into account correlations across the variables involved in scenarios. In order to do so, 
I apply the Cholesky matrix decomposition to the correlation matrix of the 
macroeconomic parameters used in scenario modeling.  

Cholesky decomposition is applied to the positive definite correlation matrix and derives 
such a matrix X that  

𝐶𝑂𝑅𝑅=𝑍∙𝑍′ 

Where CORR is the correlation matrix of the macroeconomic variables involved in 
scenario analysis. Z is the resulting matrix and Z’ is its conjugate. I wouldn’t describe the 
step-by-step procedure, for a more detailed description of Cholesky decomposition please 
refer to Dereniowski D., Kubale M. (2004)3. As a result, when we multiply the vector of 
uncorrelated deviations by the Cholesky matrix, we arrive at the vector of correlated 
deviations of macroeconomic variables: 

{𝑋1𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟,𝑋2𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟,…,𝑋𝑛𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟}={𝑋1𝑡,𝑋2𝑡,…,𝑋𝑛𝑡}∙𝑍 

Where 𝑋𝑖𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 is the value of deviation of macroeconomic variable i which takes into 

account its correlations with all other macroeconomic variables in the scenario. 

3.3.3.  Estimating scenario probabilities 
 

For the purposes of estimating expected payoffs across scenarios, I need to evaluate the 
probabilities of these scenarios. In order to do so, I introduce the aggregate 
macroeconomic variable – AG, which is simply the sum of correlated normalized random 

                                                      
3 Can be retrieved from http://www.eti.pg.gda.pl/katedry/kams/wwwkams/pdf/Cholesky_fmprg.pdf 

deviations of macroeconomic variables. As it is the sum of normal random variables, it is 
itself a normal random variable. Since it is the sum of standard normal random variables, 
its mean is equal to zero, and its variance is equal to 

And as we are assuming equal weights (𝑤𝑖=𝑤𝑗 ∀𝑖,𝑗) on all the variables, then this 

formula can be rewritten as 

 

𝑛
 
𝜎𝐴𝐺2 =�𝑤𝑖2
+2∙�𝑤𝑖∙𝑤𝑗∙𝜌𝑖,𝑗
𝑖≠𝑗
𝑖=1
𝜎𝐴𝐺2 =1𝑛+2𝑛2∙�𝜌𝑖,𝑗
 
𝑖≠𝑗

 

Where 𝜎𝐴𝐺2  is the variance of AG variable, n is the number of macroeconomic variables 
used in scenario analysis, 𝜌𝑖,𝑗 is the correlation between macroeconomic variables i and j. 

The value of AG is estimated for each generated scenario in order to evaluate the 
scenario probability. We now know the distribution of AG: 

𝐴𝐺~𝑁(0,𝜎𝐴𝐺2) 

However, we cannot calculate probability of a scenario by simply taking one point 
(probability of hitting exactly a certain point is zero for any point chosen). That is why I 
start from the worst scenario and evaluate its probability as inverse cumulative normal 

probability at this point: 𝑃(𝐴𝐺=𝐴𝐺𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒)=𝑁−1(𝐴𝐺𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒) 
Where 𝑁−1 is the inverse cumulative normal distribution with zero mean and variance 
equal to 𝜎𝐴𝐺2 . For the remaining scenarios, I evaluate probabilities as the difference 
other words, if we rank all AG values from lowest to highest, with 𝐴𝐺1=𝐴𝐺𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 

between the cumulative inverse normal distribution of the corresponding values of AG 
and the cumulative inverse normal distribution of the nearest AG value from below. IN 

then we will have the following probability formula: 

𝑃(𝐴𝐺=𝐴𝐺𝑖)=𝑁−1(𝐴𝐺𝑖)−𝑁−1(𝐴𝐺𝑖−1) 

This is how probabilities of scenarios are derived.  

3.3.4.  Bank parameter evaluation 
 

After the derivation of scenario probabilities I need to evaluate the bank parameters’ 
values in these scenarios in order to calculate the payoffs.  Payoffs are not explicitly 
observable in each scenario, so I need to evaluate the parameters that serve as the 
constituents of the payoff function. After estimating each of the parameters for all banks, 
I can estimate the payoffs under each scenario with the formula provided in Section 3.1. 

In order to estimate the banks’ parameters in each scenario, I require parameterizing their 
dependencies on the macroeconomic variables that are included in these scenarios. This 
exercise is to be performed on each of the three metrics (ROE, Tier 1 capital ratio, and 
Total capital ratio) for each of the banks in the research sample. The independent metrics 
used in the regressions should all be included in scenario modeling otherwise it will be 
not possible to calculate the forecasted parameter values in each scenario. For each bank 
parameter as a result, I obtain the following parameterization: 

𝑌𝑖=𝛽0+𝛽1∙𝑋1+⋯+𝛽𝑘∙𝑋𝑘 

Where 𝑌𝑖 is the bank parameter to be estimated under scenario analysis, 𝑋𝑗 are the 
macroeconomic variables used in the regression and 𝛽𝑗 are regression coefficients 

obtained using OLS4 approach.  

Arriving at the final result 

3.4. 
 

After all the calculations I arrive at the final goal of my research – estimating expected 
payoffs under predefined conditions:

Data and sampling 

4.1. 
4.1.1.  Banks choice 
 

For this research I am focusing on the US banks and US macroeconomic variables. In the 
macroeconomic variables I also include some parameters that characterize the state of the 
US financial system as a whole. I will later provide an overview of the macroeconomic 
variables used. As for banks, I have chosen 10 large banks (all being in Top-15 by assets 
as at the end of 2013). I have excluded Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley from my 
research as they are almost purely investment banks (although Morgan Stanley had some 
loan business, however, not significant compared to its investment banking business), and 
looking at investment banks would have required to produce an approach to account for 
their specifics. I also do not include the players owned by parent companies from outside 
the US. As discussed in the literature overview, this requires taking into account 
international shocks, and policies of the parent companies (e.g. is the parent company 
going to provide cheap funding), which for the purposes of this paper I do not touch. 
Among those not included are HSBC North America Holdings and TD Bank. I use 
quarterly observations from Q3 2001 up to Q4 2013 (including endpoints).  

The full list of banks is provided below, in Table 1.

4.1.2.  Choice of macroeconomic variables 

 

For the long list of macroeconomic variables I have chosen the key economic parameters 
as well as several metrics that define the state of the US financial system. This choice 
was based purely on expert judgment, and can be refined for the purposes of further 
research. The long list of metrics is presented below, in Table 2. 

After the long list has been produced, I look at the correlation matrix of the variables. I 
choose two with the highest correlation and if they have economically close meaning, I 
eliminate one of them. For example, out of the three stock indices I keep only one – S&P 
500. I look at the correlations of all indices with other metrics and choose the one that is 
least correlated with them in order to minimize the impact of multicollinearity on the 
regression models that are built further. 

The decisions and the short list of macroeconomic variables are presented in Table 3.

Regression analysis for bank metrics 

The next step in my calculations is estimating models for the 10 banks’ ROE, Tier 1 capital ratio 
and Total capital ratio. Here given that I have only 50 observations I choose to include no more 
than 5 regressors in the models counting the constant as one of regressors.  

In order to find the optimal regression, I run all possible combinations of factors and first select 
the group of models having the largest explanatory power (measured by R-squared). I also look 
only at the models which have all coefficients significant at 5% level or no more than one 
coefficient not significant at 5% significance level. Then I check the models for economic sense 
and choose the ones which exhibit both statistical explanatory power and make economic sense. 

Here I present the outcomes of regression analysis for the 30 models I estimate for the 10 banks 
outlined previously. For all further tables the following notation is used: 

* - coefficient significant at 10% significance level 

** - coefficient significant at 5% significance level 

*** - coefficient significant at 1% significance level

Time variable accounts for period of estimation – its value is “1” for Q3 2001 and “50” for Q4 
2013. I do not use “detrending” in this exercise as it can remove some of the significant 
relationships between parameters. For example, if loans and interest income both grow with 
time, and if we “detrend” both metrics, we will not capture the direct effect that interest income 
depends on loans.  

As we can see, J. P. Morgan Tier 1 capital ratio is pro-cyclical which means it is higher in period 
of economic stability and is lower in crises.

For Bank of America Tier 1 capital ratio results are also pro-cyclical. An interesting fact is that 
the ratio tends to decrease with time – BofA pursues less capital-solid strategy.

buffer, which is released during good macroeconomic conditions.

Wells Fargo ROE is pro-cyclical, but depends negatively on the total loans in the banking 
system. This can be explained by the competition effect – if competitors increase loans, it is 
usually accompanied by a decrease in rates which drives down ROE.

At first I estimate the expected payoffs under certainty – I look at 5% scenario buckets (worst 
5% scenarios, second worst 5% scenarios etc.) and the expected payoffs for each bank in these 
buckets. For the purpose of this exercise I assume investors are risk-neutral.  

In this case the utility function for a “pessimistic” investor is defined by the following formula: 

𝑈(𝑃𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐)= �𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖∙𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖

|𝐴𝐺𝑖≤𝐴𝐺5% 

10000
𝑖=1

Where 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖 is the probability of i-th scenario; 𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖 is the payoff in i-th scenario; 𝐴𝐺𝑖is the 
value of macroeconomic aggregate in i-th scenario; 𝐴𝐺5% is the value of macroeconomic 
𝐴𝐺5% is 5%) 

aggregate corresponding to the 5% worst scenarios (probability of AG being less than or equal to 

This means that a “pessimistic” investor expects the economy to be in the worst 5% of scenarios 
and makes his choice based on the expected payoffs within this set of scenarios. 

For an “optimistic” investor the utility function takes the following form: 

𝑈(𝑂𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐)= �𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖∙𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖

|𝐴𝐺𝑖≥𝐴𝐺95% 

10000
𝑖=1

Where 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖 is the probability of i-th scenario; 𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖 is the payoff in i-th scenario; 𝐴𝐺𝑖is the 
value of macroeconomic aggregate in i-th scenario; 𝐴𝐺95% is the value of macroeconomic 
𝐴𝐺95% is 95%) 

aggregate corresponding to the 5% best scenarios (probability of AG being more than or equal to 

This means that an “optimistic” investor expects the economy to be in the best 5% of scenarios 
and makes his choice based on the expected payoffs within this set of scenarios. 

Below are the results obtained (0%-5% means 5% worst scenarios, on the y-axis there are 
expected payoffs for banks in each range of scenarios):

What insights can we obtain from this chart?  

•  The bank choice depends on investor expectations – there is no universal optimum 
•  PNC yields quite plausible payoff in adverse scenarios, but underperforms all others in 

positive scenarios 

•  Bancorp leaves the Top-5 only in the most positive scenarios and remains the leader for more 

than half scenarios 
In positive scenarios, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third are the leaders, but they show low payoffs 
in crises 

• 

•  Next come Capital One and J.P. Morgan 
•  Citi and New York Mellon show moderate payoffs under all scenarios with very little 

volatility 

•  Bank of America is a better choice if investors expect a crisis than if investor expectations 

are positive 
 
Now if we move to uncertainty, we introduce the risk-aversion parameter. Here instead of 
looking at different scenario buckets, I am looking at the expected payoffs over all scenarios, 
but now with different attitude towards risk. 

Here investor utility is defined by the following formula: 

10000
𝑈= �𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖∙𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖𝛼
𝑖=1

 

Where 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖 is the probability of i-th scenario; 𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖𝛼 is the payoff in i-th scenario 

adjusted for the investor’s risk-aversion. 

So, investors maximize the expected payoff raised to the power of their risk-aversion 
parameter over the whole set of scenarios.

On the chart above you can see the expected payoffs of different banks raised to the 

power 1/𝛼 for the purposes of comparability. On the x-axis there are values of the risk 
aversion parameter𝛼.  

Here there is a set of interesting findings: 

1.  I have found that there is no difference between the preferences of risk-averse and 

risk-neutral investors if we are comparing the expected payoffs over the whole set of 

scenarios (that is why I am not showing risk-aversion degrees less than 1 on the chart 
above) 

2.  Riskier banks exhibit parabolic function form towards higher degrees of risk loving 

3.  More stable banks have their expected payoff relationship to risk-loving degree more 

in a linear form 

5. 

 

4.  With the increase in love for risk the choice of banks for the investor changes 

dramatically (PNC, Fifth Third and Capital One occupy Top-3 places in terms of 
expected payoff compared to Bancorp, Wells Fargo and New York Mellon for the 
risk-neutral investor) 

Model limitations and potential for further research 

To begin with, the model could be extended to a larger set of banks / other financial 
institutions. In fact, it can be extended to non-financial institutions as well. This will 
allow having a more comprehensive assessment closer to the one an investor usually 
faces in real life. The most obvious extension here is to include large banks owned by 
foreign companies and investment banks. This will require further investigation of 
interdependencies not covered in this paper. 

In addition, the set of macroeconomic variables used for estimating bank parameter 
models could also be extended. For example, we could also take into account 
international shocks. This could be particularly important as many banks (e.g. Citi) have 
international businesses. 

Another potential amendment which is often discussed in the literature is incorporating 
feedback effects – how the changes in banks’ profitability / capital adequacy impacts 
macroeconomic variables. 

One more potential for the model refinement is simply to generate more scenarios thus 
increasing model stability. I go with 10,000 scenarios due to computational limitations – 
running 100,000 requires more machine time and more memory. 

When estimating the payoff function, instead of using the capital ratios, better predictors 
for bank insolvency may be found – for example, also taking into account default 
probabilities of banks and / or liquidity metrics. 

One important issue with the proposed model is that correlations across macroeconomic 
variables are assumed constant, whereas in reality they tend to be higher during adverse 
scenarios.  

Finally, as it has been proposed by many researchers, it is important to go for the highest 
granularity possible and to estimate effects separately on various business lines / 
portfolios in order to correctly capture all the dependencies.

Conclusion 

In my research I find out several things about optimal investor choices among the 10 
banks considered: 

1.  Under certainty, there is no universal winner 

2.  For “pessimists” the top 3 picks would be PNC, Bancorp, and Bank of America 

3.  For “optimists” the top 3 picks would be Fifth Third, Wells Fargo, Capital One 

4.  There is no difference in preferences between risk-averse and risk-neutral investors – 

for both the top 3 picks are Bancorp, Wells Fargo and New York Mellon 

5.  Very risk-loving investors would find it optimal to invest in PNC, Fifth Third, and 

Capital One 

There is still large potential for extending the model (increasing its scope) and increasing 
its accuracy, which is mainly based on higher granularity, accounting for feedback 

effects, making a wider choice of explanatory variables, and running more simulations to 
ensure stability of solutions.
