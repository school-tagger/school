Abstract

Nowadays idiosyncratic productivity shocks have a signiﬁcant consequences in an

aggregate production. We consider a model of an economy, where ﬁrms experi-

ence i.i.d. productivity shocks. In such an economy some speciﬁc capital allocation

rules can lead to minimization of aggregate ﬂuctuations. We deﬁne three classes of

investment rules, which are resulting in vanishing of the uncertainty in the aggre-

gate economy. Our innovation is a proportional capital allocation, when each ﬁrm

receives new capital according to some Borel measurable function of its productiv-

ity. After that we examine dynamic properties of the aggregate output, savings and

capital holdings under different strategies of capital distribution and determine the

most optimal one.

Introduction

Macroeconomic models typically consider the effect of aggregate shocks on eco-

nomic variables such as aggregate savings and output growth. The role that id-

iosyncratic risk may play in generating aggregate ﬂuctuations is usually ignored.

However, there are evidences that support that persistence of idiosyncratic shocks

in the economy increases over time.

It is a widely known fact that distributions of the capital and production have

positive skew. Thus in the economy most of the ﬁrms have small or intermediate

size, however most of goods are produced by large ones. For example, in the U.S.

in 2013 sales of top 10 companies exceeded 13% of total GDP, sales of the ﬁrst

50 companies were over 35% of the GDP (ﬁg. 1). Therefore productivity and, as

a result, sales of individual ﬁrms from the top of the list play a considerable role

in the aggregate behavior of the economy. Hence, idiosyncratic shocks to these

companies can lead to a sufﬁcient changes in the aggregate output.

Irvine and Schuh (2002) consider empirical data for the U.S. economy and show

that after 1984 the economy was subject to the following stylized facts:

• Firm-level production volatility has considerably risen.

• Volatility of aggregate output on contrary signiﬁcantly decreased.

• Covariance between ﬁrms and between industries declined.

If we assume that the micro-structure of the economy (ﬁrm-level volatility and

inter-ﬁrm correlations) is an exogenous parameter, arises a very interesting question

concerning the mechanism of reduction of the aggregate ﬂuctuations in such an en-

vironment. There are different views on this issue: Stock and Watson (2003) argue

that this result can be achieved through improvement of the inventory management

and the proper monetary policy. Dynan et al. (2006) show that the aggregate volatil-

ity reduction may be caused by the ﬁnancial innovations (e.g. development of loan

markets etc.). We examine how this result can be obtained through the regulation

of the investment strategies. Speciﬁcally, we consider how at the economy, where

ﬁrms experience independent and identically distributed productivity shocks, dif-

ferent investment rules can be used in order to minimize volatility of the aggregate

production.

We want to determine long-term effects of a short-term investment decisions

driving by the current ﬁrm productivities. In such an economy savings will be a

function of only a current state of nature and rate of return, therefore each period

investments would not depend on the expectations on the future path of the econ-

omy. For this purpose we choose an Overlapping Generations model as a baseline

because it exhibits all the underline features. We consider the OLG growth model of

Polemarchakis and Dutta (1992), which describes an economy with a population of

ﬁrms that experience independent and identically distributed productivity shocks. If

3

investment decisions are made before the realization of productivity, the limit econ-

omy converges to the risk-less one with constant aggregate production. However if

new investments can be reallocated ex-post, aggregate productivity in general is not

a constant because of the persistence of sunk production of less efﬁcient ﬁrms that

use the capital that was accumulated during previous periods. Their result leaves

open the question of the stationarity of such an economy: in fact, in general it will

not be stationary. Our innovation is consideration of the proportional capital alloca-

tion rules, when ﬁrms receive new capital according to some invertible continuous

function of its productivity. This distribution of the capital leads to vanishing of the

aggregate ﬂuctuations, whereas the aggregate level of the output exceeds the one

obtained under ex-ante capital allocation.

Our approach is consistent with the literature on Real Business Cycles, albeit

preserving the role of idiosyncratic risk in generating aggregate ﬂuctuations. Kyd-

land and Prescott (1982) show that the delay of adjustment of the capital leads to

aggregate ﬂuctuations. They consider agents who make the optimal decisions on

the level of consumption and investment subject to the expected future aggregate

productivity level. The innovation of the model is that today’s investment does not

increase tomorrows capital. Because of the lag between the investment decision and

the change in the capital stock, the model ﬁts the cyclical variance of economic time

series fairly well. We also consider the long term effect of the investment decisions,

but instead of aggregate ﬂuctuations we want to examine the effect of individual

shocks.

There are many papers, which consider idiosyncratic risks and try to ﬁnd the

path of all economy due to such risks. One of classical models that study idiosyn-

cratic risks is Aiyagari (1994).They consider an impact of stochastic labor income.

Agents, who are faced with borrowing constraints, optimize their expected utility

subject to idiosyncratic labor and deterministic income from risk-less bond. Ac-

4

cumulated asset holdings reﬂect the history of agent’s individual shocks.

In the

equilibrium per capita asset holdings coincide per capita capital level. The model

argues that under the idiosyncratic risk the capital holdings are higher than in the

complete market equilibrium, whereas the interest rate is lower than its complete

market analog. Even though this model is very good in explanation of the equilib-

rium path of the aggregate savings, this approach does not capture some important

features that we wish to examine. Firstly it does not deal with capital-related risk.

Secondly the behavior of the aggregate production does not studied properly. In our

paper we want to study the risk that is determined by stochastic capital income and

results of the aggregate output of the economy.

Angeletos (2007) considers the idiosyncratic risk of capital income. House-

holds have access to production technology and to risk-less bonds. Production is

stochastic and independent across agents. As a result markets are incomplete and

the economy is risky. Angeletos receives similar to Aiyagaris result of the lower

level of interest rate. But in his model this fact does not imply increase in the cap-

ital level. In general the space of all possible states of the world in such economy

is inﬁnite, nevertheless if it is used a Cobb-Douglas production function with linear

return on capital and there is a homoscedasticity of preferences all optimal invest-

ment decisions are linear functions of the agents wealth. It gives an opportunity to

reduce the number of dimensions, which are needed to describe the equilibrium, and

ﬁnally to solve the model and to make some simulations. Angeletos and Panousi

(2011) study a two-country extension of this model, that helps them to explain the

cross-country differences in the interest rate and capital accumulation. But Angele-

tos (2007) and Angeletos and Panousi (2011) examine economies where capital

depreciates fully: we do not. As a result every period each agent makes a decision

on the level of capital that does not directly depend on the previous capital level,

whereas in our approach the ﬁrm’s capital holdings is a function of previous capital

5

level and current productivity.

Even though Krusell and Smith (1999) consider a welfare effects of eliminat-

ing business cycles, their approach of modulating of ﬂuctuations is close to ours.

They study an economy with agents, who experiences idiosyncratic uncertainty in

employment in the next period. Because of the fact that probability to be unem-

ployed in the next period depends on the unemployment rate as well as on the cur-

rent agent’s status, this model represents a direct dependence of the state on the

previous sequence of shocks. However Krusell and Smith consider inﬁnite living

agents, which may allow them to consider dynamic strategies, whereas our model

represents a sequence of static decisions.

Carvajal and Polemarchakis (2011) examine the effect of the idiosyncratic en-

dowments on the Pareto efﬁciency of the equilibrium allocations. They have found

spaces of preferences that under additional constraints on the level of diversiﬁca-

tion of the commodities, which can be traded, guarantee an existence of ﬁnitely

many Pareto efﬁcient equilibria. However they consider two period model: we

multi-period. As a result our model allows us to consider long-term effects of the

individual shocks.

Gabaix (2005) considers questions that a very close to our. He shows that

idiosyncratic shocks can help to explain aggregate ﬂuctuations in the economy.

Huggett and Ospina (1998) describe a steady-state equilibrium in the model with

idiosyncratic labor income. Khan and Thomas (2011) study an (S,s) equilibrium in

the economy with heterogeneous productivities, debt and capital holdings. Bian-

coni and Turnovsky (2003) show aggregate effects of individual shocks, but their

main point is an individual gain from the regulation of the aggregate shock. San-

tos Monteiro (2008) study multiple equilibria that are generated by the idiosyncratic

labor risk. Antunes et al. (2008) look for the stationary equilibrium of the general

equilibrium models with independent exogenous abilities, endogenous bequest and

6

ﬁnancial market with deadweight costs. Hopenhayn and Prescott (1992) study the

stability of invariant distributions of stochastically monotone processes.

The paper proceeds as follows. We present the model in Section 2, study aggre-

gate outputs under different investment rules in Section 3. In section 4 we examine

different classes of the investment rules and ﬁnd optimal shapes of capital distribu-

tion functions. Finally, in section 5 we study the dynamic properties of the economy

under different investment rules and discuss which ones are more preferable.

2 Model

In our paper we consider an Overlapping Generations model with agents living for

two periods and inﬁnitely living ﬁrms and ﬁnancial intermediate. Agents has an

endowment of labor when they are young. They supply their labor to competitive

ﬁrm and use the wage for consumption and savings. Households’ savings go to the

ﬁnancial intermediate that guaranties competitive ﬁxed capital income and invests

the capital in the ﬁrms operating in the economy.

The combination of the Overlapping Generations model with inﬁnitely living

ﬁnancial intermediate was chosen because it allows us to concentrate on the long-

term effects of the short-term investment decisions and individual shocks under

different allocation strategies.

2.1 Households

Representative agent, who is young in period t chooses optimal levels of con-
sumptions in both periods (Ct
t+1) and savings (St) taking wage (wt) and
interest rate (rt) as given in order to maximize his intertemporal utility function
U(Ct

t+1), where β ∈ (0,1):

t ) + β ·U(Ct

Subject to:

Optimization yields (3). An explicit solution can be obtained after speciﬁcation

of the utility function. We are going to use a standard notation - log-utility (i.e.
U(Ct) = log(Ct), which gives us (4).

The result (4) consistent with the intuition:

• As consumption during the ﬁrst period is more valuable, the agent consumes

more, when he is young (Ct

t > Ct

t+1).

• Sum of the consumption and savings during the ﬁrst period equals to the total

labor income of the household (Ct

t + St = wt).

• When the wage is proportional to the income (which is true for example for
Cobb-Douglas production function) savings of the households are propor-

tional to the output at the correspondent period.

2.2 Firms

(5)

Firms can choose only labor, whereas capital is endogenously distributed be-
tween ﬁrms and productivity (θnt) is randomly assigned to each ﬁrm every period.

The capital of each ﬁrm changes by the following law:

knt = (1− δ )· kn t−1 + zn t−1

0 ≤ δ ≤ 1

(6)

Given the capital holding, productivity and wage level each ﬁrm maximizes its

proﬁt, which will be paid to the stockholders as dividends:

max{lnt}[πnt] = max{lnt}[xnt − lnt · wt]

First Order Condition:

Plugging in (9) and (11) into (5), we can obtain an equilibrium output of each

ﬁrm in period t (12). As we can see after the optimization the output of any arbitrary

ﬁrm is a function of not only endogenous for it parameters (capital, productivity)

10

but also of the joint distribution of the capital and productivity of all the others ﬁrms.

The output of the whole economy can be obtained by the summarizing of the

lated buy plugging in all the parameters (capital holdings and productivity) of each

ﬁrm, but, as it will be shown below, under some capital-distribution rules the aggre-

gate result can be simpliﬁed and, as a result, can be written using some aggregate

terms regardless the micro-structure of the distribution.

2.3 Financial Intermediate

As it was mentioned above, ﬁnancial intermediate operates inﬁnitely, assuming de-

posits of the households and investing in ﬁrms. The net proﬁt - ﬁrms’ dividends

(ﬁnancial intermediate is assumed to be the only stockholder of all the ﬁrms) minus

11

payment to households - is used for consumption. Therefore ﬁnancial intermediate
chooses the distribution of the new investments between the ﬁrms (zit) in order to
maximize the utility of its consumption in the current and all proceeding periods

subject to three constraints. The ﬁrst constraint is a pure budget constraint of the ﬁ-

nancial intermediate, the second one is the same as (6) - capital ﬂow equation of the
ﬁrm n and the last constraint yields that total investment cannot exceed households’
deposits.

As we have agreed before households make their savings at the end of their ﬁrst

period, when the productivities of the ﬁrms during the next period are not known

yet. Therefore the fair rate of return of their savings will be equal to the expected or

just average marginal product of capital.

1 + rt−1 = E(1 + rnt)

(17)

This optimization problem (14, 15) cannot be solved explicitly, however we

can consider different classes of rules of capital allocation and compare the long

term effects of these actions. Therefore we need to make some assumptions on the

preferences of the ﬁnancial intermediate.

• Financial intermediate has the time preference coefﬁcient βFI close to unite,
so its valuation of the consumption today and tomorrow are practically iden-

tical.

• Financial intermediate has sufﬁcient degree of risk-aversion such that it tends
to make investment decisions in order to smooth its consumption as much as

possible.

In the next section we’ll consider three generalized types of the capital alloca-

tion: ex-ante allocation, when all the ﬁrms get the same amount of capital, and two

speciﬁcations of the ex-post allocation: when only the most productive ﬁrm gets

new capital and when each ﬁrm receives capital accordingly to its productivity. Un-

der some additional conditions these allocation rules will give the absence of the

uncertainty on the aggregate behavior of the economy.

13

3 Aggregate Economy

In this section we will consider aggregate behavior of the economy under differ-

ent investment rules. As all individual ﬁrms uses the same production technology

(Cobb-Douglas, which gives us the fact that cost of capital is a constant fraction of

the output) and the return on households savings is predetermined each period, the

optimization problem of the ﬁnancial intermediate shrinks to the optimization of the

aggregate output given risk-less output. Therefore we can skip optimization prob-

lems of ﬁrms, households, ﬁnancial intermediate and concentrate on the aggregate

effect of different investments.

3.1 Ex-ante Allocation

Firstly, let’s consider the simplest variation of the model, when the investment de-

cision is done before the realization of the productivities. In this case all ﬁrms are

ex-ante identical, hence, the investment is equally distributed between all of them.

The timing of the model:

• Households save some fraction of its labor income.

• Financial Intermediate assumes savings and distributes capital between the

ﬁrms.

• Realization of productivities of all ﬁrms.

• A decision of each ﬁrm on the optimal level of labor.

• Production.

• Payment of dividends, wages and deposits.

14

As it was assumed before the capital is equally allocated between all the ﬁrms
N ). Hence, the aggregate output (13) can be rewritten as

From the equation (18) we can conclude that the output of the whole economy

depends on the aggregate capital stock and aggregate productivity shock. As indi-

vidual shocks are iid, the aggregate are independently distributed. Moreover when
the number of ﬁrms goes up without bound the aggregate productivity vt converges
to a constant. The proof of this fact that uses Strong Law of Large Numbers can

ﬁnding. The sum of the individual productivities to the power of

be found in Polemarchakis (1992). I would like just to discuss the intuition of this
1
1−α divided by
the number of ﬁrms equals to the sample average of the productivity shock to the
1
1−α . Under the Law of Large Numbers the sample average converges to
the expected value. Thereafter we will use this fact and associate the sum of func-

power of

tions of the individual shocks divided by the number of the ﬁrms with expectation

of this function under the assumption of the inﬁnitely large size of the economy.

Therefore aggregate output in the limit economy equals to the:

E(θ 1

(19)

3.2 Ex-post Allocation: Simple Case

Much more interesting result can be obtained if there is a possibility to allocate

the new capital after the realization of the productivities. In this case ﬁnancial in-

termediate will be able to allocate its investments taking the ﬁrms’ productivities

into account. As now the amount of information available for the investor before

15

making the decision is higher than in the previous example, obviously there is such

investment rule, that gives at least the same level of the aggregate output.

At ﬁrst glance when all the productivities are realized investment in the most

productive company seems rather rational. Obviously the short run effect of this

decision will outperform the output in the case of the equal capital distribution.

However the behavior of the economy in long run is not so clear. Therefore let’s

consider this case in details.

The continuation of the model in this case is as follows:

• Households save some fraction of its labor income.

• Financial Intermediate assumes savings.

• Realization of productivities of all ﬁrms.

• Financial Intermediate transfer all the new capital to the most productive ﬁrm.

• A decision of each ﬁrm on the optimal level of labor.

• Production of the most productive ﬁrm and the sunk production of the others.

• Payment of dividends, wages and deposits.

From the equation (16) the marginal product of capital of each ﬁrm doesn‘t

depend on the initial capital holdings of the ﬁrm. It depends only on the productivity

level and the wage that is set in the economy. Thus, only the most productive ﬁrms

would increase their capital holdings using new investments.

Proposition 1.
If X1,X2, ,Xn are iid random numbers distributed with the function F(X), than
max{i}Xi is distributed with probability function Fmax(X) = Fn(X).

Proposition 2.
If X1,X2, ,Xn are iid random numbers distributed with the function F(X), than
max{i}Xi converges to a constant with probability 1.

Proof.
Assume Prob (Xi < X) = 1− 1

From the proposition 1 Prob (maxi Xi < X) =(cid:0)1− 1
such n0 that for all n > n0 we have(cid:0)1− 1

As f (x) = ax is continuously decreasing positive function of x when, a ∈ (0,1) for
any ε > 0 there is such x that f (x) < ε. Therefore for any N > 2 and ε > 0 there is
< ε. Hence, as number of iid random
variables increases maximum of these numbers converges to the upper bound of

(cid:1)n

N

their distribution with probability 1.

When the number of ﬁrms increases, the distribution of the maximum of pro-

ductivities shrinks to the one number (see proposition 2). Therefore the new capital,

as it was mentioned above, will get the ﬁrm with the maximal possible productiv-

ity. Without loss of generality we can assume that only one ﬁrm has the maximal

productivity level, otherwise two or more ﬁrms will share the new capital, but as

17

the MPK doesn‘t depend on the capital level in our set up, the aggregate production

will be the same as if only one ﬁrm gets all new investments.

Let‘s denote the index of the most productive ﬁrm by m. Then the capital hold-

ings of ﬁrms (6) in period t are

Where µt is a weighted average productivity shock. Note that in this setup ˜vt
depends not only on the maximal value of productivity among all ﬁrms, but on the

market capitalization of ﬁrms in the previous period (as long as the depreciation

is less that 1). The latter does not converge to a constant even if the number of

ﬁrms is sufﬁciently large. The intuition of this conclusion can be explained using

the following example. Assume that in period t al ﬁrms had the same amount of
capital. In period t+1 ﬁrm m1 was the most productive. Hence, in this period the
distribution of capital was

kn t+1 = (1− δ )· kn t = (1− δ )· Kt
N ,
km1 t+1 = (1− δ )· km1 t + Zt = (1− δ )· Kt

n (cid:54)= m1

N + Zt

(26)

In period t+2 the most productive ﬁrm is m2 (cid:54)= m1 and new distribution of capital

19

is

n (cid:54)= m2

kn t+2 = (1− δ )2 · Kt
n (cid:54)= m1
N ,
km1 t+2 = (1− δ )2 · Kt
N + (1− δ )· Zt
km2 t+2 = (1− δ )2 · Kt
N + Zt+1

(27)

And so on. After T steps the distribution of capital will be

where a j

zero otherwise (a j

i (cid:54)= ak

i , if j (cid:54)= k).

So, the capital holdings generally are not the same, moreover the allocation of

capital changes over time even if the aggregate capital remains constant. It leads to
the uncertainty of the aggregate productivity of the economy ( ˜vt), which depends
on distribution of capital and on the iid shocks. As a result such an economy is

risky. In Polemarchakis (1992) it is shown that there is a stationary equilibrium in

such an economy only if there is full depreciation. Let’s brieﬂy consider this case.

From the equation (26) when δ = 1

knt = 0, n (cid:54)= m
kmt = Zt−1

(29)

Using (25), (29) and the fact that the most productive ﬁrm has maximal possible

productivity (θmax) the aggregate output equals to

This simple case helped us to understand that the ex-post capital allocation can

skew the equilibrium output of the economy. Moreover the simplest and the most

obvious rule, when all the new capital goes to the most productive ﬁrm, can signiﬁ-

cantly increase the aggregate output of the economy under condition of full capital

depreciation. Unfortunately, without the condition of the full depreciation the so-

lution is not stable and can‘t be considered for the further research. In the next

section we will consider other investment rules that can be used under the ex-post

reallocation.

3.3 Ex-post Allocation: Proportional Allocation

Now let’s assume that after the realization of the productivity shocks capital is dis-
tributed proportionally to the shocks. Let f (x) is some Borel measurable function1,
1Let (X,Fx) and (Y,Fy) be measurable spaces. A function f : X → Y is said to be (Fx,Fy)-

measurable if f −1(A) ∈ Fx for any A ∈ Fy.

22

we don‘t specify it now, further we will consider different variants of its realization.
The ﬁrm that experiences productivity θi will obtain
capital. As we have a restriction on the short sell of the existing capital, the fraction

fraction of the new

f (θi)
∑N
n=1 f (θn)

that ﬁrm will obtain should be non-negative for any realization of the shock. To
guarantee this result we need f (x) ≥ 0,∀x ∈ D(θ ). Moreover as ﬁnally all the new
capital should be distributed between the ﬁrms the function of the shock should have

positive values for the non-empty set of the realizations of shocks. This approach is

fairly reasonable, the sum of the fractions adds up to one, under the assumption of
the increasing function f (x) the more productive is the ﬁrm, the more capital it will
receive.

Assume that initially (at the period t − 1) all ﬁrms held the same amount the

capital (ki t−1 = Kt−1

N ,∀i ∈ [1,N]). Therefore at the period t ﬁrm i will have:

kit = (1− δ )· ki t−1 + zi t−1 = (1− δ )· ki t−1 +

f (θit)
∑N
n=1 f (θnt)

· Zt−1

(33)

And so on. After p steps the capital holdings of the i‘th ﬁrms are equal to:

Using the fact that individual shocks are identically distributed and that the dis-

in the equation (35) under the expectations.

Note that now on the last step we cannot skip all the time indexes under the

expectations. We are not able to do this because the Borel measurable functions of

the shocks taken with different lags are independently distributed (proposition 4).

Proposition 3.
Sigma-algebra generated by any Borel measurable function f (x) is not bigger than
the sigma-algebra generated by the random variable x (i.e. σ ( f (x)) ⊆ σ (x)).

Proof.

This fact follows from the deﬁnition of the Borel measurable function.

Proposition 4.
For any Borel measurable functions f (x) and g(x) if x1 and x2 are independent
random variables than f (x1) and f (x2) are also independent.

Proof.

This fact follows from the proposition 3.

25

Therefore using proposition 4 we can rewrite the sum in the brackets from the

equation (36) as follows:

Comparison of the results of calculation of the output 1 and p periods ahead
((35) and (40)) shows that under the proportional reallocation the economy becomes

risk-less if at some arbitrary period of time all ﬁrms held the same amount of the

capital. Moreover if the capital depreciation is greater than zero and the economy

uses the proportional reallocation rule for sufﬁciently long time, than the effect of

the initial unequal capital allocation can be neglected.

In this case the distribution of the capital holdings of each individual ﬁrm be-

comes stationary, that is does not change over the time (see Appendix A). As indi-

vidual capital holdings represent a whole history of individual productivity shocks
and follows the same stochastic stationary process, ”long-run distributions for an
individual coincide with cross-section distributions for the population” Aiyagari
(1994).

To make a thumbnail estimation of the goodness of the effect of the proportional

ex-post reallocation, let’s compare the aggregate output of the economy with such

type of the capital reallocation (40) and without it (19). For this purpose let‘s re-

call that expectation of the product equals to the product of expectations plus the

covariance. Therefore it is convenient to rewrite the equation (40):

(41)

As a result when f (θ ) is positively correlated with θ 1

1−α and has positive mean2,
the aggregate output of the economy with ex-post proportional reallocation outper-

forms the output without re-allocation. The intuition of this result is very straight-

forward, when the ex-post capital reallocation is done to increase the aggregate out-

put of the economy, it is quite obvious that more productive ﬁrm should gain more

new capital rather than the less productive. The latter gives us positive correlation

of the capital distribution and the productivity level.

In the next section we will try to ﬁnd the speciﬁcation of the function that would

maximize the aggregate output. Obviously this speciﬁcation will depend on the

distribution function of the shocks. To simplify calculations we will assume that

the shocks are drawn from the uniform distribution with positive values.

2As it was discussed above for any realization of the shock the f (θ ) should be non-negative and
should be positive for the non-empty set of shocks. Obviously the expected value of this function of
the shock is positive.

28

4 Proportional Allocation: Optimal Function

As we have shown in the previous part the aggregate output in the economy with

proportional ex-post reallocation is stable and exceeds the output in the case of

the absence of the reallocation. Now it makes sense to investigate how the exact

speciﬁcation of the capital distribution function changes the aggregate output of

the economy. From now assume that the productivity shocks are distributed with
uniform distribution U[θmin,θmax] with θmin > 0.

4.1 Linear Function

The simplest and very common group of functions as linear functions, i.e. functions
that can be written as f (x) = a·x +b with a (cid:54)= 0. We will start our analysis with type
of functions because even though this functions are very simple in use, the linearity

of the expectation can lead to interesting results.

Firstly let‘s consider the fraction from the brackets in the equation of the aggre-

gate output (41).

Now let’s try to ﬁnd the values of a and b that would maximize this expression.
As b is left only in the denominator, the whole expression increases when b de-
creases. Recall that f (θ ) > 0 for all possible values of θ, therefore b has a lower
bound ( a· θmin + b ≥ 0 ⇒ b ≥ −a· θmin). Combining the fact that the expression
increases when b decreases and the presence of the restriction we have that the in-
equality for b binds. Thus b = −a·θmin. After plugging in the optimal value of b to
the equation (43) we will get that the expression does not depend on the value of a.

Hence, the optimal shape of the linear function is f (x) = a · (x − θmin) with
a > 0 (note that we eliminate negative values of a because x− θmin is not negative
for any realization of the shock and the value of the function of the shock should be

non-negative, as we have discussed before). The intuition that in the class of linear

31

function optimal solution gives only this shape is rather clear:

• It is optimal to allocate a zero fraction of the capital to the less productive

ﬁrm ⇒ f (θmin) = a· (θmin − θmin) = 0;

• Let‘s consider two different realizations of the function: f1(x) = a1·(x−θmin)
and f2(x) = a2· (x−θmin) ∀a1 > 0,a2 > 0,a1 (cid:54)= a2. The fraction of the capital
that will receive the ﬁrm with productivity θ does not depend on the choice of
the function:

4.2 Power Function

The next type of functions that we will consider is the power functions, i.e. func-
tions of the form f (x) = xγ. The power functions are fairly convenient to use in our
context, because we can always ﬁnd an integral of the power function, therefore the

explicit solution of the equation of the aggregate output exists.

Even though we cannot ﬁnd the explicit solution for the optimal level of γ, the
result can be obtained either numerically after determination of all the parameters
of the economy (θmin,θmax,α) or using approximation under the assumption that
θmax−θmin
(cid:28) 1. Under this assumption we can rewrite equation using the lin-
1− ( θmin

γ =

(48)

Now let‘s discuss the intuition of the result. From the assumption that (cid:52)
θmax

(cid:28) 1
we can conclude that θmin ≈ θmax = θ, therefore 2 · θmin − θmax ≈ θ. Thus γ ≈
(cid:29) θ. As a result the power of the function is sufﬁciently high, i.e. the ﬁrm
θmax−θmin
with higher productivity will obtain more capital rather than the one with lower

θ

productivity, which is consistent with our previous analysis.

4.3 Exponential Function

The third speciﬁcation of the function is an exponential, i.e.

f (x) = eφ·x. In this
case the part of the expression for the aggregate output with the covariance term

will be as follows:

In general, the integral in the nominator can be written using the gamma-function,
but if we specify the the value of the α the result will be much easier. For example,
when α = 0.5 as we have considered before, equation (49) can be simpliﬁed:

·(2· (eφ·(θmax−θmin) − 1) + (θmax − θmin)· φeφ·(θmax−θmin)

φ · (eφ·(θmax−θmin) − 1)

Again this equation can be solved numerically, when all the parameters of the

economy are known, or under the assumption of the relatively small distance be-
tween θmax and θmin. We will use the latter technique. After some calculations:

max + θmaxθmin − 2· θ 2

φ 2θmax · (θ 2
= φ · (θmax − θmin)· (φ · θ 2

min)

max − θmax + θmin)· (3 + φ · (θmax − θmin))

(52)

This equation can be approximated after eliminating of the members that are

35

proportional to the θmax − θmin to the power larger than 1:

φ ≈ 1
θmax

or φ ≈ − 1

3· θmax

(53)

Consistently to the ours previous intuition ﬁrm with higher productivity level

should obtain more new capital rather than less productive one. Therefore the power
of the exponent should be positive, so the only optimal solution is φ ≈ 1
θmax

.

4.4 Logarithmic Function

Finally let‘s consider logarithmic functions, the solution we will search in the form
of f (x) = log(c· x) = log(c) + log(x).

(54)

As we can see the nominator of the equation (54) does not depend on the choice
of the parameter c. Therefore the value of c that minimizes the denominator in the
space of positive values (this condition we need because the nominator obviously is

positive). Moreover similarly to the case of the linear function we have to remember

that the value of the function should be non-negative for any realization of the shock
(i.e.∀θ : log(c) +log(θ ) ≥ 0 or just c ≥ 1
θmin
yields that the latter one binds, so c = 1
θmin

). Combination of these two constraints

. In this case equation (54) gives us:

(55)

Here we have used a linearization of the logarithm under condition of close θmin
and θmax. Finally, to calculate the covariance we have to specify the value of α, as
usual, let α = 0.5.

θmin · cov(cid:0)θ 2;log(θ )(cid:1)

(56)

Again the last step in the equation (56) using the linearization under the assump-

tion that θmax and θmin are close enough.

Now when we have found optimal shapes of the distribution functions from dif-

ferent main classes, we can proceed to the consideration of its dynamic properties.

In the next section we will study impulse response functions of the aggregate output

under different investment rules. As a result we will be able to compare resulting

ﬂuctuations and select optimal investment rule.

37

Impulse Response Functions

In the previous sections we have considered different types and functions of capi-

tal allocation. All this investment rules give us different resulting behavior of the

economy. In this section ﬁrstly we will provide the classiﬁcation of all studied in-

vestment rules with its properties. Then we will study the dynamic properties of

these rules: amplitude and length of the shock persistence.

Table 1: Considered investment rules.

To ﬁnd impulse response functions ﬁrst of all we need to calculate the steady

state production level, capital holdings and other parameters of the economy. After

that we will introduce a one period production shock, for instance, assume that in
the period t production was 10% higher than the equilibrium level. Using equations
for households’ savings, capital ﬂow and aggregate output we will be able to ﬁnd

the path of the economy after the shock.

5.1 Ex-ante Allocation

We will consider investment rules in the same order as we have in the previous

sections. The simplest distribution was done in the case of ex-ante allocation. To

38

ﬁnd a steady state we need to combine equations for the aggregate output in this

case (19), aggregate capital ﬂow (38), household savings (4):

Let’s now assume that Xt = φX · X. The shock in the output will shift savings.
This change does not have to be proportional to the shock as the households’ expec-

tations on the marginal product of capital will change. The level of the aggregate
capital does not change in this period, so φK = 1. Values of the deviation of the
capital and output at the next period we will denote with hats.

This recursive system of equations can be solved after determination of the ini-
tial parameters of the system. Assume φX = 1.1 in this case the diagram of the
impulse responses of the output (ﬁg. 2) shows us that the latter gradually declines

to its initial value. Moreover the rate of convergence decreases with depreciation

rate. Capital holdings experience 1 period lag as the deviation of the capital occurs

only after installation of the new capital (ﬁg. 3).

The phenomenon that rate of convergence decreases with depreciation can be

explained by the fact that when the fraction of the new capital in the equilibrium is

not too high the deviation of the new investment does not shift aggregate parame-

ters too much. Moreover the fact that all the ﬁrms receive the same amount of new

capital whatever has happened leads to the lack of optimality of the capital alloca-

tion, therefore higher shocks decreases slower. The diagram of the response of the

capital (ﬁg. 3) can help to understand the previous explanation even better: from
the graph we can see that the deviation of the capital, when the δ = 0.2 is almost 10
times lower than when δ = 1.0. Therefore when the value of depreciation is signif-
icantly high the response of the capital holdings is fairly high, it leads to rather high

deviation of the output the next period as the only variable source of production -

capital was shifted.

5.2 Ex-post Allocation: Simple Case

Now let’s move to the case of the ex-post capital allocation. As we have agreed this

case will be considered under condition of the full capital depreciation. Therefore

41

the system of the equations that describes this economy is slightly different from

(57).

pretty much similar to ones that we have obtained in the previous case.

5.3 Ex-post Allocation: Proportional Allocation

tional capital allocation. This investment rule requires to solve the following system

of equations:

We can notice that the system (65) is practically the same with (59) the only

difference is that there are brackets with covariance in the denominator of the last

equation.

Impulse response functions for all types of proportional allocation are very close
to each other (up to the 6th decimal)it was because covariance over the expectation
are rather close for this functions too, moreover the fraction of these members in

the ﬁnal result is fairly small.

Interesting difference in the case of proportional capital allocation from the case

of the ex-ante allocation is that even if the initial deviation from the steady state

of the parameters increases with the depreciation rate, the rate of convergence also

is higher when depreciation is higher. The possible explanation in this case is that

44

more optimal capital allocation provides an opportunity to the economy to behave

in better way. The result of this superior behavior is faster movement to the equilib-

rium path.

capital allocation and with initial deviation of the output by 10%.

5.4 Comparison

To summarize the results let’s consider all the investment rules and the level of the

output that can be obtained under different rates of depreciation.

Table 2: Aggregate output level.

As we can see all the investment rules leads to rather close level of the aggregate

output. However proportional allocation outperforms ex-ante allocation under any

values of depreciation rate. Among all types of the proportional capital allocation

the best results have linear and logarithmic functions. This result intuitively is very

clear: optimal parameters of the linear and logarithmic functions gives zero capital

investment in the company with the lowest possible productivity, therefore capital

was distributed more optimal.

There is no surprise that under full depreciation the best performance shows

simple case of ex-post capital allocation. Obviously, we cannot do better than invest

all the money to the most productive ﬁrm, if we 100% sure that the next period this

ﬁrm would not use any capital in case if it is not the most productive once again.

Comparison of the impulse response functions of the aggregate outputs (7) gives

us the result that proportional capital allocation has the highest convergence rate

under full depreciation. From the previous discussion we can conclude that propor-

tional allocation has grate convergence rate than the one in case of ex-ante allocation

because of the more optimal capital investment. From this point of view it is not

clear why the simple ex-post capital allocation has slower convergence rate than

46

proportional allocation. But recall that simple ex-post allocation has the highest

level of the aggregate parameters and aggregate productivity, therefore the same

response in capital holdings has higher effect on the aggregate production.

Figure 7: Aggregate output in the economy with full depreciation and with
initial deviation of the output by 10% under different investment rules.

As a result we cannot give a general answer on the question, what type of capital

allocation one should choose. When we deal with the depreciation rate smaller than

one, there is no doubt that linear or logarithmic allocation should be selected, as

both of them have the highest aggregate level of output and the rate of convergence.

More tricky question occurs when we have full capital depreciation. On the one

hand, simple ex-post allocation has higher level of production, on the other hand,

proportional allocation has higher rate of convergence to the equilibrium path. The

ﬁnal decision on the allocation rule under full depreciation should be done with

respect to the individual preferences and the risk tolerance.

47

6 Conclusion

There are different approaches of explanation of the stylized facts that describe

recent behavior of the U.S. economy: decline of the aggregate ﬂuctuations subject to

increased level of the ﬁrm-speciﬁc shocks. In this paper we show that some classes

of distribution of new investment among ﬁrms can diminish aggregate uncertainty

in the economy. We have deﬁned 3 classes of the capital investment rules that

gives stationary distribution of the capital between the ﬁrms in the economy and

under which aggregate ﬂuctuations of production vanish. The ﬁrst class is so called

ex-ante capital allocation, when the distribution occurs before the realization of

the individual productivities. The second one is a simple case of ex-post capital

allocation, when only the most productive ﬁrm assumes new capital each period.

Unfortunately, stationary equilibrium in such an economy exists only under full

capital depreciation. The last studied class of distribution rules is our innovation

and it deals with proportional ex-post capital allocation, when each ﬁrm receive

new capital accordingly to some Borel measurable function of its productivity.

All classes of the capital allocations that we consider guarantee the persistence

of the stationary capital distribution in the economy. As a result joint distribution

of productivities and capital holdings of ﬁrms are stationary as well. Latter leads to

the steady state equilibrium in the aggregate economy.

Among capital allocation rules that give stationarity without full capital depre-

ciation best performance exhibit linear and logarithmic proportional capital alloca-

tions. Equilibrium production level and the convergence rate to the equilibrium path

are the highest in this cases. This phenomenon can be explained by the diminished

fraction of the new capital that goes to less productive ﬁrms.

A Stationarity of the Capital Distribution

By the deﬁnition the distribution of capital is stationary if the joint distribution of

capital holdings of individual ﬁrms is time invariant. We will proof it using the

wide-sense stationarity, i.e. when the mean and auto-covariance functions do not

depend on time.

Recall that capital holdings of ﬁrm i are described by the equation:

(A.2)

Here we use explored above facts that in the equilibrium total investments are

a constant fraction of the output, which is constant in equilibrium too. Therefore

expected value of capital holdings does not depend on time, that is remains constant

over time.

(A.3)

As we can see from (A.3) covariance does not depend on the values of T1 and T2,
but only on its difference. Therefore, mean and covariance of the capital holdings

does not vary over time. Consequently, we can conclude, that the distribution of the

capital of any arbitrary ﬁrm is stationary.
