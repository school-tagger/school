по теме «Динамический анализ кассовых сборов фильма» 

 

Практически каждый из нас хотя бы раз в своей жизни, так или иначе, сталкивался с 

продуктами,  относящимися  к  индустрии  кино:  многие  смотрят  телевизор,  некоторые 

ходят  в  кинотеатры,  покупают  DVD  диски.  Всё  это  обеспечивает  огромный  охват  и, 

соответственно,  огромные  возможности  для  данной  индустрии  не  только  в  плане 

искусства,  но  также  и  в  плане  получения  существенных  прибылей.  Таким  образом, 

создание  фильма  можно  рассматривать  как  инвестиционный  проект,  бесспорно,  очень 

сложно  прогнозируемый  и  дорогостоящий,  но  при  грамотном  менеджменте  и  удачном 

стечении обстоятельств такой проект может существенно обогатить своего инвестора. Для 

примера,  можно  рассмотреть  фильм  «Паранормальное  явление»  (2007  год),  без  участия 

звезд  мирового  кино,  с  бюджетом  в  15  000  $,  который  только  на  кассовых  сборах 

заработал более 193 миллионов долларов (то есть проект с каждого потраченного на него 

доллара  принес  в  12  000  раз  больше)  и  тем  самым  существенно  обогатил  инвесторов, 

рискнувших  вложить  в  него  свои  деньги.  С  другой  стороны,  известны  случаи,  когда 

фильмы с безупречными статическими начальными данными (бюджет, актерский состав, 

режиссеры,  сюжет)  «проваливались»  в  мировом  прокате.  Например,  фильм  «Терминал», 

снятый в 2004 году, входящий в список 250 лучших фильмов мира по версии известного 

русскоязычного портала kinopoisk.ru, с бюджетом в 60 миллионов долларов и при участии 

таких  звезд  мирового  кино  как  Стивен  Спилберг,  Том  Хэнкс  и  Кэтрин  Зета-Джонс, 

заработал  всего  лишь  70  миллионов  долларов  (что  намного  ниже  прогнозируемого 

уровня).  Стоит  отметить,  что  сборы  этого  фильма  в  первую  неделю  несущественно 

отличались от сборов более успешных проектов с участием Тома Хэнкса. Данный пример 

демонстрирует,  что  прибыльность  фильма  часто  определяется  не  столько  статическими 

начальными  данными,  сколько  тем,  что  происходит  в  динамике  (внимание  к  фильму, 

пиратство и пр.). Простой статический анализ, на наш взгляд, имеет очень ограниченные 

прикладные возможности в отношении описания эффектов, влияющих на сборы фильмов. 

Например,  эффект  выхода  пиратского  контента  (который  для  дистрибьютеров  фильмов 

является  одним  из  самых  важных  и  проблемных)  просто  некорректно  рассматривать  в 

статике,  так  как  в  зависимости  от  времени  выхода  копии  в  итоге  фильм  теряет 

существенно  разные  доли  своей  выручки.  Возможно,  в  данном  случае  более  правильно 

 

2 

говорить в терминах потерь после выхода этого контента и механизмов их минимизации, 

что подразумевает динамический анализ. 

Учитывая  всё  вышесказанное,  при  написании  данной  работы  мы  ставили  своей 

целью провести максимально полное динамическое исследование по оценке зависимостей 

подневных  кассовых  сборов  фильмов,  которые  выходили  в  американский  прокат  за 

последние 10 лет (с 2004 по 2014 год), от таких динамически изменяющихся параметров 

как  количество  кинотеатров,  выходные  и  праздничные  дни  во  время  проката,  внимания 

аудитории  к  фильму,  пиратство  в  зависимости  от  качества  выпускаемой  нелегальной 

копии и самого фильма, а также доступности этой копии для простого пользователя сети и 

пр.  Для  оценки  внимания  к  фильму  мы  использовали  статистику  поисковых  запросов 

Google  по  ключевому  слову,  соответствующему  названию  данного  фильма,  в  период  его 

проката  в  США,  ограниченную  по  категории  и  региону.  Что  касается  анализа  проблемы 

пиратства,  одной  из  задач  нашей  работы  была  оценка  потерь  кассовых  сборов  фильма 

после  выхода  нелегального  контента  в  хорошем  и  плохом  качестве  для  кинокартин 

разного  уровня.  Для  детального  анализа  данной  проблемы  была  предпринята  попытка 

оценки так называемых «затрат на поиск» (searching costs). Одной из гипотез, которую мы 

хотели протестировать, было предположение, что после первого выхода пиратской копии 

(этот момент определялся с использованием сайта VCDQ.com) и до появления этой копии 

на  крупных  ресурсах  (в  нашем  случае,  на  популярном  торрент-трекере  The  Pirate  Bay) 

данный  контент  не  является  легкодоступным  для  простого  пользователя,  поэтому  его 

влияние на кассовые сборы фильма не такое разрушительное, как могло бы быть.  

Стоит  отметить,  что  для  данного  исследования  был  собран  и  обработан  огромный 

объем  исходных  данных.  Так  для  анализа  было  выбрано  1264  фильма,  при  этом  полная 

база  (произведение  дней  в  прокате  каждого  фильма  на  количество  фильмов)  состояла  из 

81787 строк. 

В итоге в данной работе нами были получены следующие результаты: 

  Эффект  зависимости  выручки  от  количества  кинотеатров  крайне  нелинеен  и 

обладает  свойством  убывающего  эффекта  от  масштаба  (показатель  степени  равен 

0,77 и статистически существенно отличается от единицы). 

  Выходные  увеличивают  выручку  на  86%,  125%  и  79%  для  пятницы,  субботы  и 

воскресенья,  соответственно.  Праздники, к  тому  же,  дополнительно добавляют  еще 

57% к выручке. 

  Наибольшая связь между поисковыми запросами и сборами фильма обнаруживается 

с задержкой в 1 день. Более того, исследование показывает, что эффект от точечного 

повышения внимания к фильму рассеивается за 1-2 недели. 

 

3 

  Эффект  пиратства зависит  как от качества фильма (которое измерялось с помощью 

IMDb рейтинга: фильм признавался плохим, если его рейтинг меньше 6,00), так и от 

качества  самого  пиратского  контента.  Для  условно  плохого  фильма  при  выходе 

экранной  копии  (снятой  на  камеру  в  кинотеатре)  выручка  падает  на  33%,  а  при 

выходе копии в хорошем качестве  – на 52%. Для условно хорошего фильма потери 

выручки  составляют  26%  и  33%,  соответственно.  Можно  сказать,  что  чем  хуже 

фильм  и  чем  лучше  качество  пиратского  контента  –  тем  больше  потери  от  выхода 

нелицензионной копии. 

  «Затраты на поиск» (searching costs) существенны, так как при появлении пиратской 

копии  на  известных  интернет  ресурсах  (в  частности,  на  The  Pirate  Bay)  кассовые 

сборы уменьшаются дополнительно на 12-20%. 

 По  результатам  динамического  исследования  был  проведен  статический  анализ 

зависимости  основных  индивидуальных  констант,  определяющих  динамику  сборов 

фильма  от  начальных  параметров  фильма  (продолжительность  фильма,  участие  звезд, 

жанр и пр.). 

Полученные  результаты  вместе  с  собранной  базой  могут  быть  использованы  как  в 

качестве  основополагающих  факторов,  определяющих  поведение  и  основные  риски 

дистрибьютеров  во  время  проката,  так  и  для  дальнейших  исследований  с  применением 

более  сложных  структурных  моделей.  Все  это  может  быть  полезно  при  выработке 

статического  плана  и  динамических  стратегий  производства  и  проката  фильма  для 

увеличения и стабилизации его итоговой выручки.

Introduction 

Almost  everyone  on  the  planet  has  been  exposed  to  the  movie  industry  in  one  way  or 

another at least once in his or her life. Ever since the creation of the first film in 1906, and the 

first  studio  in  1911,  the industry  saw  tremendous  growth,  quickly  turning  into  one  of  the  most 

prominent areas of business. 

Creating a new film often requires a huge amount of investment, which is quite risky since 

it is difficult to predict the box office revenue of the movie before its production begins. Some 

factors, such as celebrities’ participation, a well-known director or a scriptwriter, big budget or 

even favourable market conditions may raise potential revenues. Nevertheless, they are far from 

being  either  necessary  or  sufficient  conditions  for  a  movie  to  be  a  success.  For  example, 

“Paranormal  activity”  (2007),  with  the  budget  of  15000$  and  no  celebrities  in  the  cast,  earned 

more than $193mln, which implies the profitability ratio of over 12 000! However, there are also 

a  lot  of  examples  when  the  movie  investment  was  not  so  profitable.  For  instance,  “Sahara” 

(2005), despite substantial production costs of $241mln and Penelope Cruz participation, earned 

just  a  little  more  than  $110mln.  “The  Terminal”  (2004),  ranking  147  in  the  list  of  250  best 

movies at kinopoisk1, would be another example. Although it was directed by Steven Spielberg 

(3  Oscars  and  12  Nominations)  and  included  such  celebrities  as  Tom  Hanks  (2  Oscars  and  3 

Nominations)  and  Catherine  Zeta-Jones  (1  Oscar)  among  the  cast,  the  film  earned  a  relatively 

modest amount of $77mln in domestic total gross revenue, barely exceeding its production costs 

of  $60mln.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that,  while  the  movie  earned  about $13.74mln  during  the 

opening  weekend,  which  was  quite  similar  to  some  other  Tom  Hanks  projects,  such  as  “The 

Green  Mile” ($13.37mln)  and  “Road  to  Perdition” ($15.47mln),  the  total  gross  of  “The 

Terminal” turned out to be about twice as low as the average total domestic gross of all the other 

movies with the same actor. 

These  examples,  in  particular  the  latter,  show  that  a  simple  consideration  of  the  standard 

exogenous static parameters might be not enough for accurate and robust prediction of the box 

office  revenue.  Instead,  we  should  consider  changes  in  dynamic  parameters  throughout  the 

whole screening period. Potentially, this could allow us to promptly identify the reason and the 

moment  when  something  starts  going  wrong  with  the  movie  produced,  and  aptly  respond  to 

stabilize or even increase its box office revenue.

Arguably, one of the most important dynamic factors for a movie’s financial success is the 

marketing  policy  and,  respectively,  public  attention.  When  discussing  related  literature,  we 

demonstrate that Google search volume indices (SVI), provided by Google Trends service, could 

be  successfully  used  to  measure  the  degree  of  public  interest.  There  is  a  set  of  papers  which 

show  that  performance  of  the  models  with  Google  SVI  is  significantly  better  than  the 

performance  of  the  models  without  this  indicator  (e.g.  Varian  and  Choi  (2009),  Kholodin  et  al 

(2010)  etc.).  In  a  different  setting,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  Google  SVI  has  a  substantial 

predictive power in the inﬂuenza epidemic spread forecasts (Ginsberg et al. (2009)), which led to 

the subsequent creation of a new service, Google Flu Trends, with the aim to notify people and 

prevent a further spread of the disease. 

With  widespread  technological  growth,  however,  there  has  emerged  another  important 

factor that could substantially affect the box office revenue - piracy. Illegal downloads have been 

the  driving  force  behind  many  changes  in  the  media  industry  during  the  last  decade  or  two. 

Before the piracy became really widespread, musicians, for instance, could earn enough money 

by  issuing  new  albums  and  making  small  concert  tours  in  their  support.  Today,  when  every 

person with internet access can easily listen to any song on the web (sometimes even before the 

official  release), the situation has changed dramatically:  now musicians are forced to  make big 

tours all over the world after the album issue to support the revenues. 

The  problem  of  piracy  is  especially  acute  in  Russia  due  to  historically  relatively  weak 

enforcement  of  the  intellectual  property  laws,  with  only recent  antipiracy  law  enactment. 

However,  with  the  widespread  internet  penetration  and  ever  increasing  data  exchange  speeds, 

piracy is no longer limited to a particular country, but is a global phenomenon.  

Substantial  resources  are  spent  on  fighting  the  piracy. There  are  special  persons  whose 

work  involves  protecting  a  movie  from  being  stolen  on  the  pre-release  step  or  during  the  box 

office period in the form of a sample copy by the cinema employees. They also monitor social 

networks  and  torrent  trackers  in  order  to  send  requests  to  block  the  illegal  content  should  it 

become available after the movie theatre release. Such proactive monitoring may prove it more 

difficult for the users to find an illegal copy of a movie, essentially increasing the corresponding 

searching  costs  and  thereby  reducing  consumption  of  the  illegal  content  and  mitigating  the 

negative effect of piracy on the revenue. 

Going  back  to  the  example  of  “The  Terminal”,  piracy  might  have  indeed  played  a 

significant role in its financial failure: after all, this was the year when The Pirate Bay, probably 

the largest torrent tracker, was founded and instantly gained a huge popularity. In fact, the first 

 

7 

illegal copy of “The Terminal” in good quality appeared on the site only 8 days after the actual 

movie release. This could explain, for instance, why the initial movie revenue was comparable to 

the  similar  Tom  Hanks  movies,  but  subsequent  returns  turned  out  to  be  substantially  lower. 

Therefore, we consider piracy as one of the important factors influencing financial success of the 

projects in the movie industry, and incorporate it into our model. 

This  paper  suggests  a  reliable  dynamic  reduced-form  model  for  the  movie  revenue  as  a 

function  of  various  filming  and  screening  characteristics,  including  the  degree  of  public 

attention, the distribution chain features, star participation, runtime, various calendar effects, etc. 

Most importantly, we pay particular attention to the impact of electronic piracy on the financial 

success of the movie. We discuss how the effect will depend on the various characteristics of the 

latter,  i.e.  film  grade,  the  quality  of  the  illegal  copy  and  its  availability  for  an  unsophisticated 

internet user. 

In  order  to  model  the  effect  of  various  film  characteristics  on  the  box  office  revenue,  we 

have  created  a  new  database  of  the  movies  released  in  the  USA  during  the  last  decade.  This 

involved  writing  a  special  script  that  would  extract  the  relevant  information  according  to 

particular  algorithms  from  the  various  publicly  available  sources  and  combine  it  in  a  single 

dataset. The database contains a lot of information regarding particular films, including (but not 

limited  to)  the  presence  of  stars  in  the  cast,  daily  revenues  dynamics,  distribution  details, 

calendar  effects  for  the  state  holidays/weekends,  movie  genre,  runtime,  budget,  and  other 

characteristics. Piracy presence is measured by screening the contents of The Pirate Bay tracker 

and VCDQ illegal content list, paying particular attention to the pirated content release date and 

its  quality.  Finally,  we  also  trace  the  Google  Search  Volume  Index  that  relates  to  a  particular 

movie from a month prior to the film release up to the end of the screening period. This allowed 

us to  create a unique dataset  with  the information covering over 1200 movies produced during 

the  last  decade    (to  be  more  precise,  in  average  each  movie  had  approximately  70  time  points 

which  resulted  in  more  than  80,000  records  total,  used  for  the  dynamic  analysis).  The  full 

description of the dataset and its composition/algorithms could be found in the Data section. 

We  build  a  dynamic  reduced-form  model  for  the  daily  stream  of  box  office  revenues  and 

make a number of interesting empirical findings. 

  The effect of an additional cinema theatre on screening revenues is highly nonlinear, and 

there appear to be decreasing marginal returns. 

 

8 

  As  expected,  calendar  effects  have  a  substantial  impact:  during  the  public  holidays  the 

revenue  on  average  increases  by  57%  and  on  Friday/Saturday/Sunday  by  86/125/79% 

respectively. 

  Public attention, as measured by prior values of the Google Search Volume Index, seems 

to  have  the  highest  effect  on  the  future  movie  attendance  within  the  span  of  one  to  2 

weeks. 

  Piracy impact on the film revenue depends on the quality of the movie (as measured by 

the  IMDB  rating  with  a  threshold  of  6.0)  and  its  electronic  copy.  In  particular,  other 

things being  equal,  the  availability of  a low quality illegal  copy of the movie decreases 

daily revenues by 33% for “bad” movies compared with only 26% for “good” ones. High 

quality copy leads to revenue changes of 52% and 33% accordingly. We also prove that 

the  effects  of  “bad”  and  “good”  quality  illegal  content  vary  significantly  inside  and 

between these groups. 

  Searching  costs  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  illegal  content  consumption  and  its 

effect  on  box  office  revenue.  We  find  that  the  availability  of  a  movie  on  a  renowned 

tracker (such as The Pirate Bay) has an additional negative effect on the daily revenues of 

12-20% (depending  on the quality of the film  and its electronic copy) and this effect  is 

statistically different between the groups. 

  Overall the results suggest that the piracy is related to a substantial negative impact on the 

box office revenue, and that the worse is the movie, the stronger it seems to be  affected 

by it. 

The  model  developed  in  this  paper  has  impressive  explanatory  power  (as  measured  by  the 

in-sample R-squared), and could be empirically tested to develop the recommended distribution 

scheme  depending  on  the  movie  features.  The  economic  impact  of  the  piracy  is  assessed  and 

shown to be decreasing with the quality of the movie and associated searching costs.  

The paper is organized as follows: 

  Section 1 provides a literature review 

  Section 2 discusses the database collected for the research 

  Section  3  introduces  the  main  reduced-form  model  for  the  numerical  dynamic 

analysis  

  Section 4 presents the results of the dynamic analysis 

 

9 

 

In section 5 we discuss the static modeling results and the effects of the static movie 

characteristics on the box office revenue path-defining individual variables 

  Section 6 provides main results and conclusions 

  Section  7  contains  a  small  survey  of  possible  ideas  for  the  future  analysis  and 

unresolved questions

Search volume data: 

Literature Review 

It is relatively recently that Google search volume index variables have started to appear 

in economics-related scientific works. One of the pioneering papers in this area where predictive 

power of the index was exposed and exploited is Varian and Choi’s “Predicting the present with 

Google trends” (2009). In this article the authors show how Google search data might be used to 

predict economic activities in the variety of different areas. The authors demonstrate that sales in 

different areas such as automotive, home, car insurance sales etc. strongly correlate with search 

volume  indices  for  the  appropriate  keywords  in  the  investigated  categories  (see  the  picture 

below).  

Furthermore,  the  model  predictions  obtained  by  running  the  simplest  regressions 

including SVI match the real data fairly well. 

Picture 1 

Then, Schmidt and Vosen (2009) examine models based on both search volume indices 

and  public  surveys  and  concluded:  “Google  Trends  is  a  very  promising  new  source  of  data  to 

forecast  private  consumption.  In  almost  all  experiments  conducted  by  the  authors  the  Google 

 

11 

indicators’  in-sample  and  out-of-sample  predictive  power  proved  to  be  better  than  that  of  the 

conventional survey-based indicators”.  

Also Kolodin et  al. (2010) investigate private consumption models and  find statistically 

significant  evidence  that  models  with  Google  search  statistics  data  offer  an  improvement  over 

the benchmark models without SVI.  

 The most interesting paper concerning box-office revenue prediction, in which scientists 

used  search  volume  index,  was  written  by  Goel  et  al  (2010).  In  that  paper  the  authors  have 

shown  that  what  consumers  are  searching  in  Google  can  also  predict  their  collective  future 

behaviour  days  or  even  weeks  in  advance.  In  the  section  devoted  to  the  movie  performance 

predictions the authors analyze a database of the opening weekend box-office revenues for 119 

films released in the United States between October 2008 and September 2009 and find that the 

predicted  result  suggested  by  the  simplest  linear  model  concerning  only  search  volume  index 

matched real data well even if this prediction was based on the search index that was taken four 

to  six  weeks  before  the  movie  release.  Furthermore,  they  come  to  the  conclusion  that  search 

volume  data  improve  the  predictive  power  of  these  models  when  included  as  a  parameter  into 

other  models.  The  authors  also  point  out  that  in  absence  of  other  data  sources,  or  where  small 

improvements in the predictive performance are material, search queries might provide a useful 

guide to the nearest future. 

  

Piracy and box-office revenue: 

In  this  section  I  would  like  to  start  with  brief  introduction  of  a  paper  written  by  Rafael 

Rob and Joel Waldfogel “Piracy on the silver screen” (2007). In the article the authors analyze 

the data, obtained from the series of surveys administered to over the 500 undergraduates in the 

year 2005. Undergraduates had to choose whether they saw film or not and had to choose where 

they  saw  it  from  the  given  list  of  possible  answers.  There  were  4  paid  methods  (the  cinema, 

theater,  television,  rental  and  purchase)  and  2  unpaid  ones  (watching  a  downloaded  copy  and 

watching  a  burned  copy  of  a  legally  obtained  copy  of  the  film)  only  one  of  which  might  be 

chosen for a given movie. Also it was necessary to fill in an integer number: 1 or 2 etc. if they 

had seen the movie for the first time, for the second time and so on (choosing the way they saw 

the  movie  from  the  list).  Moreover,  the  researchers  asked  their  respondents  about  their  family 

income, race and age, speed of the internet connection they have  but in addition they took into 

consideration variables, characterizing the respondents’ interest toward the movie industry: how 

often they go to the cinemas, how many movies are in their collection and their level of interest 

in  watching  movies.  Having  analyzed  this  database,  the  authors  conclude  that  unpaid 

consumption  constitutes a  small  share  of  the  movie  industry  products  consumption  even  in  the 

 

12 

sample of technically sophisticated college students  with good  Internet connection.  Despite the 

results, the authors suggest that it partially owed to the fact that file sharing systems were clumsy 

at that time, and the searching costs of obtaining an illegal copy may play a significant role, but 

if the available means for copying movies become easy to use, file sharing could evolve into a 

very  serious  threat  to  the  film  industry.  Comparing  movie  industry  with  music  industry,  where 

piracy was all too common, the authors underline that even if the searching costs and any other 

costs of obtaining a film illegal copy fall, the two industries would still remain different because 

of the  consumption  costs: watching a movie requires a few hours of attention, which is  costly. 

Thereby,  the  movie  is  costly  to  consume  even  if  it  is  obtained  for  free.  This  argument  is  very 

sensible even nowadays when searching costs seem to be relatively low, but people prefer going 

to cinemas and pay rather than spend their time to watch a movie for free but in a worse quality. 

The costs of consumption in particular nowadays seem to be the key factor that mitigates the low 

quality  piracy  effect  on  the  box  office  revenue  because  of  the  idea  that  people  do  not  want  to 

spend their time watching  movies in  a bad quality  without  much pleasure. Consequently, these 

costs  force  them  to  go  to  the  cinema  or,  at  least,  wait  for  the  time  when  high-quality  illegal 

content will be released. 

Another remarkable article, written by Ma et al (2011), which, in some sense, played the 

role  of  a  starting  point  for  our  research,  is  titled  “Effect  of  pre-release  piracy  on  box-office 

revenue”. The authors analyze effects of pre-released piracy (when the stolen copy of the movie 

becomes available before the official  release) on the box office revenue.  We should  emphasize 

the  fact  that  pre-released  piracy  differs  from  other  types  of  piracy  in  terms  of  the  clientele  it 

attracts.  It  is  a  popular  argument  that  if  consumers  were  really  interested  in  the  content,  they 

would  buy  the  legitimate  version,  which  usually  has  higher  quality.  Whereas  those  who  are 

satisfied  with  the  low  quality  pirated  version  have  low  willingness-to-pay  for  the  content  and 

would  not  have  bought  the  legal  version  anyway.  However  in  the  case  of  pre-released  piracy 

people  who  downloaded  the  illegal  copy  might  download  and  watch  even  the  copy  with  poor 

quality  just  because  they  wanted  to  see  the  film  as  soon  as  possible.  On  the  other  hand  there 

exists a hypothesis that the pre-released piracy may also increase the box-office revenue because 

of the possible word-of-mouth information spread generation, which can substitute an expensive 

advertisement.   

The data on piracy were collected from the VCDQuality.com source that played the role 

of the piracy release log (no direct links could be founded there). The main database contained 

553 movies, 117 of which were with missing values for their budget. If the budget of the movie 

was  unknown,  the  authors  set  its  value  to  the  average  budget  of  all  the  films  under  the 

investigation  and  create  a  dummy  variable  for  the  missing  budget  that  captures  any  systematic 

 

13 

differences between the group of the films with known budgets and unknown budgets. To avoid 

inadequacy  of  the  information,  the  movies  that  were  displayed  in  the  cinema  for  less  than  six 

weeks were removed (58 items). Conclusions were made from the final dataset comprised of 475 

movies, where 48 of them had pre-released piracy. 

The structure of the dataset  used  and the source  of the information  are  presented in  the

The authors use a reduced-form exponential model in the form: 

where 

  is  the  box  office  revenue  of  movie  i  at  time  t,  and

and

represent  the  market  potential 

and  the  rate  of  decay  of  the  movie,  respectively,  which  depend  on  the  movie  static  parameters

ititniitemyityiminsuch as celebrities participations, IMDb rating etc. and the dummy variable for the pre-released 

illegal copy availability for movie i.  

The main results of the article are the following: pre-release piracy decreases the market 

potential  but  also  increases  the  rate  of  decay  (presumably  due  to  the  word-of-mouth 

mechanisms), but as a result the piracy causes approximately a 15% reduction in the box-office 

sales. Nevertheless, the authors show that the pirated copy with higher audio and video quality 

has  less  severe  impact  on  the  movie  box  office  revenues  than  the  lower  quality  releases  do.  It 

may mean that if a film in a bad quality is stolen it is better for the producers to release on the 

internet  a  copy  of  this  movie  in  better  quality  to  reduce  the  hazard  effect  on  the  box  office 

revenue. 

The  third  paper,  we’d  like  to  refer  in  the  literature  revue  is  the  article,  written  by 

Christian Peukert et al. “Piracy and Movie Revenues: Evidence from Megaupload: A Tale of the 

Long Tail?” In this research paper the authors aim to estimate the effect of the exogenous piracy 

change (Megaupload shutdown) on the box office revenue of the movie. Megaupload Ltd, a file 

hosting service, included in the top-15 list of the hosting services and once the 13th most visited 

site on the internet with  more that 180,000,000 registered members and 50,000,000 visitors per 

day2  was  established  in  the  year  2005  and  became  one  of  the  main  and  the  most  significant 

illegal  content  sources  in  the  world,  but  it  was  shut  down  by  the  United  States  Department  of 

Justice on January the 19th, 2012. This shutdown created a quasi-experiment in the market of the 

illegal downloading and allowed the authors to exploit an exogenous piracy shock to perform the 

investigation. The authors investigate 1,344 movies in 49 countries and conclude that a positive 

effect after the shutdown was found only for the blockbusters (the movies shown on more than 

500  screens).  The  rest  of  the  database  shows  insignificant  or  even  negative  effect  of  the 

Megaupload  closing.  The  scientists  argued  that  this  might  be  due  to  the  social  network  effect 

because of the fact that the information about the movie could spread from consumers with low 

willingness to pay (who download the pirated copy) to consumers with high willingness to pay 

(who  go  to  cinemas).  So  for  this  class  of  movies  publishers  may  find  it  preferred  to  release 

piracy content by themselves instead of paying for the expensive advertisement. 

 

Other models for box office revenue prediction: 

The set of works I would like to refer to in this section might be roughly divided into two 

big  groups.  The  first  group  of  papers  is  devoted  to  prediction  of  the  movie  box  office  revenue 

using  social  media  data  such  as  twitter  posts,  IMDb  comments  etc.  Asur  and  Huberman(2010)

use  the  rate  of  chatter  from  almost  3  million  tweets  found  on  the  popular  site  Twitter  and 

construct  a  linear  regression  model  for  the  box-office  revenues  of  movies  forecast.  They  show 

that  the  results  outperformed  the  models  based  on  the  Hollywood  Stock  Exchange  data3  in 

accuracy.  The  authors  also  analyze  the  sentiments  that  were  presented  in  the  tweets  and 

demonstrate  their  efficiency  to  improve  the  predictions  after  a  movie  was  released.  It  is  also 

demonstrated that analysis covering social media, such as twitter, may be extended to the large 

amount of the topics  (for example, future ratings of products), but  it may also  be  exploited for 

the prediction of election outcomes.  

In  a  more  recent  work,  Lica  and  Tuta  (2011)  analyze  modern  techniques  of  product 

success predictions and point out the main problems (which make the social media analysis very 

difficult)  of  the  social  media  sources  of  information.  The  main  issues  presented  in  the  article 

include 

  Language problem 

  Spam participation problem  

  Difficulties in recognition posts’ sentiment problem.   

The second  fundamental group of  the articles, which might  be considered as a classical 

models for movie’s box-office revenue published in the  year 1996 by  Sawhney  and Eliashberg 

and its extensions by Dellarocas et al (2007), were devoted to the attempts to construct a model 

which takes into account the time of making a decision to watch a movie and the time to act after 

this decision is made. The sum of these times was defined as the time to adopt the movie (decide 

to see and go to the cinema after this decision). Dellacotas proposes a new form for the hazard 

rate  function,  which  plays  the  role  of  the  engine  in  the  models  of  this  type,  which  take  into 

consideration  “external”  force  (advertising  etc.)  and  “internal”  force  related  to  the  word-of-

mouth of the past viewers. This function also takes into consideration the fact that the effect of 

the  pre-released  advertisement  is  falling  down  constantly  as  well  as  the  impression  about  the 

movie  (which  is  closely  linked  to  the  word-of-mouth  effect).  After  the  main  parameters 

estimation, the authors conclude that the prediction made with use of their model performed well 

enough  in  comparison  with  the  out  of  sample  movie  data.  Thus,  the  authors  conclude  that  the 

model  might  be  a  good  instrument  for  making  predictions  about  the  movie  box  office  revenue 

performance.

Movie list: 

Database 

 

Initial  movie  list,  which  were  in  the  USA  cinema  box  office  for  the  last  ten  years,  was 

collected  from  the  BoxOfficeMojo.com  weekend  charts4  taking  into  consideration  all  the 

weekends starting from the 1st of 2004 till the 10th of 2014. For the database collecting procedure 

a program on .net c# was written (powered by an html-parsing procedure). As a result of the data 

collecting,  the  list  of  the  6306  movies  was  initially  obtained  for  the  research  (not  all  of  them 

indeed had enough information for the investigations we planned to perform).  

 
Box-office revenue data: 

Box  office  revenue  information  on  the  daily  basis  for  the  movies  from  the  list  we 

described above was also taken from the BoxOfficeMojo.com web site. To be more precise, this 

resource provided us with the following dynamic data: 

  Daily gross and gross-to-date revenues  

  Daily quantity of the cinemas, average box office revenue per cinema 

  Exact date  

  Movie rank in the table of the top box office revenue for the given date  

For instance, “The Matrix Revolution” daily box office information was presented in the 

following form:  

A  part  of  static  information  about  the  distributor,  production  budget  (unavailable  for 

some  films),  movie  runtime  etc.  was  also  exposed  on  the  web  page  for  a  given  movie  on 

Picture 2 

 

BoxOfficeMojo.com site.  

It is necessary to mention that the daily box office revenue information was given not for 

all the movies from our initial dataset (only 2443 movies, which we could find in the IMDB, had 

at least one record and 1933 movies were mentioned in the IMDb5 and had at least 30 records).

5 http://imdb.com, will be discussed below 

 

17 

All the actions on collection and processing the dataset were done in the automatic mode by the 

same data-analyzing program, written by the authors.  

 

Movie static information: 

The  next  sources  of  the  information,  which  we  used  constructing  the  dataset  for  the 

analysis, was the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com).  

From this web site we got the next static data (which is constant over box office time) for 

the movie under consideration:  

  The movie crew (director, scriptwriter, up to four main actors). 

Here we decided to identify whether an actor is a star or not using a simple list of 

the best 500 actors, found at the listal.com web site. We decided to apply this method for 

the  actors  star  identification  because  there  are  a  lot  of  famous  ones  who  have  almost 

never  got  any  positive  awards,  but  still  his  or  her  participation  may  attract  people  to 

watch  the  movie:  for  instance  Steven  Seagal  got  only  Golden  Raspberry  award  for  the 

worst  role,  but  movies  with  his  participation  will  definitely  attract  attention  of  the 

audience.  Speaking  about  the  star  identification  among  the  movie  directors  and 

scriptwriters, we marked them as celebrities if they had more than one Oscar nomination 

as a best director or scriptwriter, respectively. 

  The  IMDb rating of  a movie (this  is  the rating  calculated by the special  formula 

from  the  marks  out  of  10  points,  which  any  user  may  assign  on  the  site  to  the 

particular movie).  

It  should  be  pointer  out  that  all  the  history  of  the  raiting  changes  is  inaccessible 

for us. But we make a reliable assumption that after the box office period this mark 

reaches a value which deviates form its asymptotic value insignificantly. 

  Date of the movie release 

  Budget information (may be omitted) 

  MPAA rating (age restrictive rating) 

  List of genres, related to the movie (comedy, romance etc) 

  Runtime 

  Movie distributor in the USA (Dreamworks, Warner Bros, Fox, MGM etc.) 

  Opening cinema quantity 

  Maximum amount of the cinemas during the box office period 

  Brief  film  description  (using  it  we  can  introduce  special  dummies  for  the 

particular word participation) 

 

18 

  Country-producer 

  Native language of the movie 

  Awards etc. 

It  is  important  to  note again  that all the information  obtained from  the IMDb was static 

(stay  constant  during  the  movie  box  office  period)  and  not  all  the  movies  from  the  initial  list 

were found in the IMDb. To be more precise, from the initial list of the 6306 movies only 4642 

were found in the IMDb. Only those movies were taken for the further analysis. 

Integration between the program and the IMDb web site was reached using Open Movie 

Database API (omdbapi.com).    

Google Trends 

Google Trends is a public web facility based on the Google Search engine, by the aid of 

which a search volume index for a given keyword could be obtained. This index is given in the 

form normalized to the maximum level for the given search query and overall Internet activity. 

The information may be obtained for a particular region of the world, time, category and content 

Picture 3 

(Web, News, Images etc.). News headlines, which are in some way relevant for the target search 

query, may be displayed on this graph. The service provides an opportunity to make the simplest 

prediction about  the given keyword trend behavior in  the nearest  future.    Search volume index 

for any keywords is available from the 1st of January of 2004 till now. The data used for plotting 

the  graph  may  be  downloaded  as  a  CSV  file.  The  main  disadvantage  of  the  Google  Trends’ 

 

19 

search volume index seems to be normalization of the data and impossibility to get an absolute 

value of the given search request. This  might be the reason for using Yandex Wordstat index6, 

which  provides  an  absolute  value  for  the  requests,  but  this  normalization  may  be  also  a  virtue 

because  all  the  data  are  preceded  by  Google  algorithms  (which  allows  to  cut  proxy  multiple 

requests  etc)  and  normalized  to  the  overall  internet  activity.  Moreover,  it  is  possible  to  see  the 

data  in  comparison  with  chosen  search  category,  which  provides  an  opportunity  to  see  the 

indices for two or more independent keywords on the one graph. It allows obtaining the absolute 

value approximation using a benchmark keyword method.  

Previously  mentioned  Yandex  Wordstat  service  is  a  service  which  may  supply  an 

absolute  value  of  the  search  requests  for  a  given  word  based  on  the  Yandex  Search  data,  but 

these data are not suitable for our research for the following two reasons: 

  Available index is limited by the last two years. 

  Search data are not consistent with the USA search queries since the USA Internet 

users almost never use Yandex search service. 

Concerning the data, as long as our investigation is devoted to the US box office revenue 

analysis,  only  Google  SVI  was  used.  Search  volume  index  was  limited  on  the  “Movies”  as  a 

category  and  the  US  as  a  region.  Obtained  were  daily  data  starting  from  the  month  before  the 

movie release till the end of the box office period.  

 

Piracy Database: 

One could say that a new era of piracy began when the BitTorrent protocol was created. 

This  protocol  allowed  people  to  carry  out  file  exchange  in  peer-to-peer  (P2P)  mode 

(downloading content directly from the computers of other users, connected to the P2P network) 

without uploading a file to special hosting servers. It means that if one of the P2P network users 

reaches some content (possibly illegal) and wants to share this content using P2P network (those 

people  are  called  seeds),  the  link  to  this  content  can  be  sent  to  other  users  so  that  they  can 

download the data directly from the seed’s computer. But at the same time users are becoming 

seeds  of  the  parts  they  have  already  downloaded.  Due  to  this  protocol  the  information  and  its 

source started to spread through the web very fast, so that fighting with an illegal content sharing 

distributed by this protocol became an extremely difficult task.  

Soon after the protocol  was invented new torrent tracker  web sites started to emerge all 

over the globe. These sites were just a collection of links to another computer’s content, so that a 

huge database of content stored this way did not demand a lot of space for its storage on the host 

server.

20 

One  of  the  first  torrent  trackers  was  The  Pirate  Bay.  This  site  was  founded  in  2003  in 

Sweden and shortly after the start  of its  work became a very popular torrent  exchange area  for 

people  from  all  over  the  world.  In  some  sense,  The  Pirate  Bay  became  one  of  the  hearths  of 

piracy, since the searching costs of gaining illegal content uploaded there were drastically lower 

compared to other sites. 

Concerning  our  investigations,  for  each  film  from  the  movie  database  we  obtained  the 

full  list  of  the  torrents  available  on  The  Pirate  Bay  (given  the  day  of  release,  name,  size  and 

category).  Taking  into  consideration  common  trackers’  rules  of  the  torrent  distribution 

formalization,  type  and  quality  of  a  torrent  may  be  almost  surely  obtained  from  the  torrent’s 

name or its size (for instance, the DVD repacked files due to its commonly used codec has the 

size  equals  approximately  1.4  gigabytes).  The  full  table  of  the  world-standard  piracy  movie 

markers,  their  meanings  and  related  quality,  which  was  used  for  the  quality  identification,  we 

obtained  from  the  rutracker.org  site7.  The  main  task  for  our  data  gathering  procedure  in  this 

section was to find for a given movie on The Pirate Bay web site torrents’ dates of release for the 

illegal  content  in  low  quality  format  (usually  in  the  CamRip  or  TeleSync  format)  and  in  high 

quality (frequently, this torrent files have DVDRip quality markers).  

Furthermore,  availability  of  illegal  information  on  the  Internet  in  general  was  checked 

with the VCDQuality.com service, which Ma et al (2011) used as a source of piracy information 

in  their  investigation.  This  service  provides  logs  of  almost  all  the  illegal  movie  content  with 

exact  release  date  and  quality  of  that  content  (without  any  direct  links  to  the  file).  This 

information shows that a pirated copy has already been issued and now exists somewhere on the 

web.  This  information  could  be  extremely  useful  for  our  research  because  for  a  given  movie 

name  and  a  given  quality  of  the  picture  it  shows  the  release  date  when  the  illegal  content  first 

emerged on the internet. It is noteworthy that the information about the illegal file quality may be 

obtained directly without overly complicated movie name parsing analysis as long as it is present 

in one of the columns of the table. 

These two sources of piracy information were used simultaneously to estimate the impact 

of  searching  costs  for  the  illegal  piracy  content  on  the  box  office  revenue  and  to  test  the 

hypothesis  that  even  if  some  illegal  content  emerged  at  some  site  on  the  internet  and  was 

registered by the VCDQ.com site (which, as it was mentioned above, does not provide the direct 

link  to  the  content),  but  was  not  available  for  download  on  The  Pirate  Bay  site  (or  any  other 

popular  piracy  source)  for  some  time,  searching  costs  of  obtaining  this  content  for  an 

unsophisticated internet user at that time were assumed to be substantially high. This means that

21 

the  illegal  file  will  not  be  in  substantial  demand  (that  fact  was  taken  into  consideration  as  a 

hypothesis, which will be tested in the numerical analysis part of the investigation).   

 

Database summary: 

Summing up, our daily revenue database was restricted by the 1264 most suitable for the 

analysis movies that were in the movie exhibition from the year 2004 till the year 2014 and the 

box-office  revenue  for  them  were  known  for  twenty  or  more  days.  We  restricted  the  initial 

dataset  because  in  our  research  we  were  more  interested  in  analysis  of  the  movies  that  were 

initially  created  not  just  for  the  festivals  and  other  competitions,  but  to  earn  the  money  as 

commercial projects. 

The dynamic part of the dataset we collected includes the following items: 

  Daily revenue and cumulative revenue for the given date (sometimes with missed 

values) in terms of the US dollars 

 

Information about the date (whether it was weekend, holiday etc.)  

  Availability of the piracy content for the given date and, if available, its quality. 

As it was mentioned before, the information was obtained from two sources: The 

Pirate  Bay  (with  possibility  to  download  the  movie:  low  searching  cost  piracy) 

and  VCDQ.com  (without  direct  link  for  the  illegal  content:  initial  illegal  copy 

release) 

  Google search volume index for the given movie name and given date or week if 

interest during the movie exhibition period

Dynamic model  

As we have mentioned in the literature overview section, when we discussed the article of 

Ma et al (2011), for the dynamic weekly investigation the authors used an empirical exponential 

model in the form 

(Eq. 1) where 

 was the box office revenue of movie i at the t 

weeks  from  the  release,  and

and

represented  the  market  potential  (which  in  some  sense 

equivalent to the first week revenue) and the rate of decay (exponential index) of the movie.  

Daily box office revenue profile for the ordinary movie  
(orange line – daily revenue, gray line – cinema quantity) 

Iron Man, 2008 

 

 

Table 2 

Road to Perdition, 2002 

 

As we can see on the graphs, on which the daily box office revenue curves were ploted 

for the case when the cinema profile over the box office period has an ordinary path,  the most 

common for commercial films (starting with more than 80% of the maximum  cinema quantity, 

then  growing  slightly  and  after  some  time  start  to  decrease  sharply)  the  assumption  of  an 

exponential  form  of  the  box  office  revenue  decay  over  time  seems  to  be  reasonable  and 

trustworthy. The exponential pattern might be seen considering separately the weekday revenues 

and each particular weekend. 

According to this fact, it was assumed that the exponential model in the form (Eq. 1), but 

with a special multiplicative functional, might be used to capture the daily dynamics in this case 

too.  It  is  obvious  that  this  multiplicative  functional  should  depend  on  the  indicators  for  the 

weekends: Friday, Saturday and Sunday (because as we can see from the graphs, if we select the 

group of points just for one of the given weekends, we would still observe exponential decay).  

Moving  further,  the  exponential  pattern  of  decay  might  be  difficult  to  see  on  the  box 

office  revenue  graph  of  so-called  “slipper”  movies  (the  movies,  cinema  profile  of  which  starts 

 

23 

yit=mie-nitityiminstays  some  time  at  the  low  quantity  level,  but  then  the  number  of  the  cinemas  increases 

significantly: twice or more).

These  examples  explicitly  show  us  that  the  quantity  of  the  cinemas  should  be  included 

into the exponential functional factor too. Moreover, the variables, which depend on the illegal 

content  availability,  on  the  people’s  attention  to  the  given  movie  and  its  marketing  policy 

(advertisement etc), should be also included into the considered functional factor as well.  

Concluding, the resulting empirical model, which we used in our investigation, was taken 

in  the  following  form: 

(Eq.  2),  where 

  was  the  box  office 

revenue  of  the  movie  i, 

t  days  after  the  start  of  the  box  office  period.  Further, 

and

represented the market potential and the rate of decay of the movie and depended on 

the 

static  movie  characteristics,  which  were  presented 

in 

the  previous 

section.

 represented some functions of all the available history up to time t of 

the  next  dynamic  movie  parameters:  cinemas,  exact  day  or  week,  search  volume  index  and 

available pirated content (from The Pirate Bay and VCDQ) respectively for the given film i. For 

instance, if the search volume index at time t is high it may mean that that the people will go to 

the cinema at the time t+n, at which search volume index may be not so high (because, using the 

terminology introduced by Sawhney et al. (1996) and discussed earlier, they need time some to 

act).  This  example  suggests  that  the  lagged  values  of  the  search  volume  index  should  be  also 

included in the SVI function. 

 

24 

yit=f(cit,dit,pit,sit)mie-nitityimincitditsitpitIn  the  analysis  we  performed,  the  function 

  was  taken  in  the  form, 

such that 

sum of the next summands (multiplied by their effects, which 

we wanted to estimate): 

 

1) Cinema quantity part: 

   

 

 

- logarithm of the movie quantity for the given day and the given movie 

2) Day of the week part: 

 

-dummy variable, which showed whether at the day t for the movie i was Friday 

 

-dummy variable, which showed whether at the day t for the movie i was Saturday 

 

-dummy variable, which shows whether at the day t for the movie i was Sunday 

 

-dummy variable, which showed whether at the day t for the movie i was a public holiday 

in the US 

 

-dummy  variable,  which  showed  whether  in  the  deleted  neighbourhood  (with  radius 

equals 3 days) of the day t for the movie i there were any public holidays in the USA 

 

3) Search volume index part:  

  

 

 

 

-logarithm of the lagged by 1 day search volume index for the movie i at time t  

    

 

 

-logarithm of the lagged by 2 days search volume index for the movie i at time t  

    

 

 

-logarithm of the lagged by 7 days search volume index for the movie i at time t

Here  we  should  mention  that  the  SVI  of  the  day  t  without  lag  was  excluded  because  it 

was difficult to control causality: it is not obvious whether the viewer used Google search before 

going to the cinema (for instance, checked the ticket price, tried to find the nearest cinema etc.) 

or after it (for instance, because he or she was under the strong impression from the movie and 

tried  to  find  some  more  information  related  to  the  film).  Also,  the  multiplicative  form  of  the 

model allowed us to use search volume index in the relative form (because normalizing constant 

was  fixed  for  the  given  movie  and  might  be  included  unified  with  the  market  potential  (fixed 

effect) individual film constant).  

 

4) Piracy part: 

Before the numerical analysis start we decided to divide the collected movie database into 

the  two  big  parts:  bad  movies  (defined  as  movies,  which  IMDb  rating  is  lower  than  6.00)  and 

good movies (IMDb rating is higher that 6.00, respectively). For each group we tried to measure 

the effect of piracy in the following form: 

  

 

 

- dummy variable, which showed that for the movie i at time t-1 there existed an illegal 

content  of  the  low  quality  (CAMRip  ,  TeleSync  and  similar)  somewhere  on  the  internet 

(according to the VCDQ site), but a high quality copy for the given movie at time t was not yet 

available (on that site) 

-  dummy  variable,  which  showed  that  for  the  movie  i  at  time  t-1  on  the  internet  there 

existed a high quality piracy content  

 

 

 

 

  

- dummy variable, which showed that for the movie i at time t-1 at The Pirate Bay torrent 

tracker there existed a piracy content of the low quality (CAMRip or TeleSync and related), but 

there were no high quality copy of the film up to time t-1 on this tracker (again, here we assumed 

that when the piracy content emerged at The Pirate Bay site, its searching costs became low)  

- dummy variable, which showed that for the movie i at time t-1 there existed a torrent of 

the high quality, listed on The Pirate Bay torrent tracker.

is_low_quality_piracy_available_lag1dayitis_high_quality_piracy_available_lag1dayitis_low_quality_piracy_with_low_searching_costs_available_lag1dayitis_high_quality_piracy_with_low_searching_costs_available_lag1dayitAll  the  dummies  were  taken  lagged  by  one  day  because,  in  our  opinion,  choosing 

between the real time piracy values or 1 day lagged piracy values it is more reasonable to take 

under  consideration  the  lagged  piracy  variables  due  to  many  facts.  At  first,  we  can’t  control 

explicitly what time of the day the piracy content emerged, but according to the statistical data 

and common sense, the content (especially torrents) usually emerges and start spreading rapidly 

at  the  end  of  the  day  because  of  the  fact,  that  at  the  evening  more  people  are  present  on  the 

internet.  Secondly,  we  also  think  that  the  piracy  may  affect  the  viewers’  decision  to  go  to  the 

cinema  mostly  if  an  illegal  content  was  released  at  least  one  day  before  the  arranged  day, 

because of an inertia in a decision making process and a process of booking the cinema tickets in 

the US.  

Summing  up,  we  decided  that  the  most  suitable  reduced-from  model  for  the  dynamic 

analysis we wanted to perform should be taken as follows: 

(Eq. 3), 

 where X is the matrix of movie dynamic parameters, described above, 

 - is the vector 

of their effects, which should be estimated.

Before running the main regression, we tried to check the search volume index and piracy 

arguments, included into the model we used, on the presence of multicollinearity (first “g” and 

“b” here represents whether the movie is good or bad,  “l” and “h” – low or high quality of the 

piracy content, “wsc” – without searching costs):

Table 4 

 

Analysing  the  table  of  correlations,  we  could  not  see  any  severe  multicollinearity  (the 

biggest  one  equals  65%,  which  is  not  so  critical  in  our  case)  so  that  the  analysis  might  be 

performed  using  the  reduced-form  model,  defined  above  without  being  afraid  of  the  strong 

multicollinearity. 

Speaking about the regression analysis results, the main results are presented below:

(all fixed effects and individual time trends were from the table, but they 
were included into the initial regression) 
Table 5 

From this table we can conclude the following: 

1)  All the individual variables are significant given any sensible probability level. 

2)  As  we  can  see,  revenue-cinema  quantity  rule  is  precisely  nonlinear  (cinema  quantity 

effect is equal to 0.77 and significantly differs from), which implies decreasing marginal 

returns 

test lncinemas = 1: 

F( 1, 79337) = 9474.40 Prob > F = 0.0000 

 

This  means  that  regressions  in  the  form  ln  (revenue  per  cinema)  on  all  the  remaining 

variables might be not robust and in some sense meaningless.  

3)  Holiday increases the daily revenue by approximately 57%. If there is a holiday in the 3 

day deleted neighbourhood, it increases the revenue by more than 12%. 

Film distributors may use this fact, for instance, to catch more holidays during the box office 

period and, respectively, increase the total revenue of the movie. 

4)  Weekends’ levels are distinct (+86%, +125%, +79%). Moreover, Friday’s and Sunday’s 

multipliers were proved to be statistically different    

test Friday = Sunday:    

F( 1, 79337) = 85.73, Prob > F = 0.0000 

5)  The  highest  SVI  effect  was  detected  at  the  nearest  (one  day)  lag.  Moreover,  the  search 

volume index, corresponding to the one-week lag was significantly higher than zero and 

sufficiently large. According to the results we got, the one-week lag SVI effect appeared 

to be even higher that the 2 days lag effect. It may be explained by the nonzero time to 

act,  introduced  by  Sawhney  et  al.  (1996)  in  their  paper:  people  after  making  their 

decisions  should  have  some  time  to  act,  and  this time  usually  significantly  differs  from 

zero. Our results, in some certainty, shows that the expectation of this time is in the range 

between one and two weeks (the 2 week SVI lag correlates negatively with the day t spot 

revenue, which  may suggest  that  the  effect  of the  intensive  advertisement  will go away 

after  the  2  weeks,  because  the  most  of  the  advertised  target  audience  either  go  to  the 

cinema during this period or lose their attention to the movie after that time)    

   

To  conclude,  we  can  definitely  say  that  the  viewers  usually  Google  before  going  to  the 

 

29 

cinema and that the expensive advertisement, concentrated in one single point might be not 

so fruitful, because the attention to the film will go away very fast. 

6)  Piracy hits good and bad movies in a different way. Piracy effect is more severe for the 

bad movies (we discuss the particular numbers later). 

test (badfilmlqpiracy= goodfilmlqpiracy) 

(badfilmlqcostlesspiracy=goodfilmlqcostlesspiracy) (badfilmhqpiracy=goodfilmhqpiracy)  

(badfilmhqcostlesspiracy= goodfilmhqcostlesspiracy): 

F( 4, 79337) = 17.81, Prob > F = 0.0000 

7)  Piracy  content  with  high  quality  (HQ)  hits  revenue  much  more  dramatically  (in 

comparison to the low quality (LQ) piracy content) and that difference was proved to be 

significant:  

-33%(LQ) and -52%(HQ) for bad movies    

-26%(LQ) and -33%(HQ) for good movies 

test BadFilmLQPiracy= BadFilmHQCostlyPiracy: 

F (  1, 79508) =   68.98,   Prob > F =    0.0000 

test GoodFilmLQPiracy = GoodFilmHQCostlyPiracy: 

F(  1, 79508) =   23.36,   Prob > F =    0.0000 

8)  The searching costs matter for both bad and good movies and both low and high quality. 

If  the  searching  costs  are  high  (no  torrent  on  The  Pirate  Bay  site  is  available),  it  may 

prevent from losing additional 12-20% revenue. To be more precise the distributors lose 

extra:  

20%(LQ) and 18%(HQ) for bad movies    

12%(LQ) and 18%(HQ) for good movies    

test (BadFilmLQCostlessPiracy=0) (BadFilmHQCostlessPiracy =0) 

(GoodFilmLQCostlessPiracy =0) (GoodilmHQCostlessPiracy =0) 

       F(  4, 79508) =   47.55,  Prob > F =    0.0000 

  Speaking  about  the  worst  scenario  when  pirated  content  could  be  found  without  spending 

much  time  on  searching  even  for  the  unsophisticated  internet  users,  the  analysis  we  performed 

suggests that the distributors lose the substantial box office revenue part because of the piracy. In 

 

30 

order to be more precise: 

-53%(LQ) and -69%(HQ) for bad movies    

-38%(LQ) and -51%(HQ) for good movies 

  Concluding,  we  want  to  say,  that  according  to  the  numerical  results  we  obtained,  piracy  is 

definitely not so good for the box office revenue (even for the case of the good movies with low 

screen number). But the better the movie of interest is the less severe will the effect of piracy (for 

the  case  of  a  bad  movie,  for  instance,  if  the  high  quality  piracy  copy  release  on  the  popular 

website on the Internet, it would almost kills the movie box office revenue. In this case it may be 

wise enough to consider such a scenario as closing the box office at all or reduce the amount of 

the cinemas for the given movie or, if possible, try to fight the piracy at least on the popular sites, 

where  an  unsophisticated  internet  user  might  easily  find  the  illegal  copy  without  spending  too 

much time on searching).  

 

 

It  will  be  reasonable  to  underline  that  in  the  dynamic  analysis  we  performed  the 

endogeneity  of  the  regressors  may  bias  the  obtained  results.  At  first,  we  should  say  that  the 

endogeneity here affects both the box office revenue and the time of the piracy content release in 

the same direction because the is better the movie the higher is the attention to it, the bigger is its 

revenues at the first box office days and the higher is the probability that it will be stolen soon.  

We  should  also  say  that  in  the  case  of  dynamic  investigation  it  is  very  difficult  to  avoid 

endogeneity completely: in our case piracy seems to be endogenous and depends on the attention 

to the movie, movie quality and many other factors, but the main driving factors seem to be static 

or explained by the proxy variables, which were included into the model, so that the bias in some 

degree might be adjusted because of the individual constant effect and the individual time trend 

participation in the model. 

 

 

It  is  also  possible  to  find  some  way  in  which  the  piracy  might  became  exogenous,  not 

endogenous.  For  us,  it  seems  that  the  only  possible  method  to  make  piracy  exogenous  in  the 

current  context  is  to  use  quasi-experiments  when  the  piracy  change  becomes  determined  from 

the outside is the case of the illegal content site shut down. The survey of the article written by 

Peukert et al. (2013), exploited that idea was done already in the literature review section. In this 

article  the  authors  exploited  the  judge  enforced  closing  of  the  very  famous  source  of  piracy: 

Megaupload.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  analysis  shows  very  interesting  results  (discussed 

above),  the  model  considered  there  seems  to  be  more  or  less  static  and  limited  by  the  very 

narrow  case  of  piracy.  Speaking  about  our  investigation  and  its  goals,  we  tried  to  assess  the 

 

31 

effect  of  the  every  day  piracy  on  the  spot  daily  revenues  in  dynamics  and  to  suggest  the  main 

ideas and the reference numbers for the movie distributors, which might be exploited minimizing 

the effect of piracy on the box office revenue.  

 

 

One more possibility was also to use IV regression to instrument the piracy. But having 

all  the  data  available  it  was  unsuccessful  to  find  any  reasonable  combination  to  instrument  the 

piracy  in  dynamic  in  the  case  of  the  dataset  we  collected  (all  the  remaining  data  seems  to  be 

more or less endogenous by itself and could not be used as an instruments).

Static modelling and results 

In this section we have an intention to present our results considering static analysis of the 

key dynamic-driver individual movie constants (market potential and rate of decay), which were 

estimated  during  the  dynamic  research.  As  long  as,  for  instance,  normalization  Google  SVI 

coefficient was individual and unknown but included into the constant, even here we should run 

regressions using with  individual  intercepts. Nevertheless, we run the regression for the rate of 

decay estimation in the simple form with one simple global intercept.  

As a result, we obtained the following values:

Table 6 

Interpreting  the  results  of  the  regressions  we  obtained,  we  can  say  that  the  most  optimal 

IMDb rating (the vertex of the parabola) to increase the film’s market potential should be equal 

to  7,09  (the  movie  should  be  good  enough  but,  in  some  sense,  not  very  “sophisticated”). 

Furthermore, the results of our analysis shows that the best film runtime in order to decrease the 

rate  of  decay  should  be  about  123.13  (2  hours  and  3  minutes),  which  does  not  contradict  the 

common sense (the movie should not be neither too long or too short). Moreover, it also seems to 

be  logical,  that  the  movie  runtime  affects  more  the  rate  of  decay  but  not  the  market  potential 

because when the movie had just released, it attracts mostly the audience, which wanted to  see 

this particular movie without taking into consideration whether it is too long or too short. On the 

contrary, in the middle of the box office period the runtime might play significant role because 

people  when  choosing  the  movie  to  go  usually  take  into  consideration  its  runtime.  Speaking 

about the movie genre, we obtained that the best ones (to optimize both: the market potential and 

the  rate  of  decay  simultaneously)  are  romantic  and  family.  We  also  proved  that  the  star 

participation  effect  is  the  highest  when  the  star  director  participates  the  project  (which  accuses 

market potential to be higher and rate of decay to be lower than average).  Star scriptwriters, as 

 

33 

we can see from the regression results, increase the initial jump, but also increase the box office 

revenue decay coefficient. The effect of the star actors participation seems to be counterintuitive 

to some extend, because we found that their participation causes decrease the initial revenue per 

cinema (taking into consideration that the amount of the cinemas in this case is usually higher), 

but  the  rate  of  decay  is  lower,  so  their  participation  may  be  useful  because  the  movie  will 

compensate the initial loss over the whole box office time. 

 Speaking  about  the opening  cinema quantity, as we can mentioned before, the higher  it is 

the lower will be the market potential of the movie and the higher will be its rate of decay.  

Among  the  distributors’  performance,  only  Fox  and  DreamWorks  simultaneously  increase 

the market potential and decrease the rate of decay comparing to the others.  

Finally,  considering  MPAA  rating,  our  investigation  shows  that  the  more  restrictive  this 

rating is, the better market potential and the rate of decay would see (in our opinion, because the 

main  target  audience  of  the  cinemas  is  the  persons,  who  are  young  enough,  but  have  already 

reached the full age).

Conclusion 

The  main  goal  of  this  investigation  is  to  analyze  and  estimate  numerically  the  effects  of 

piracy,  marketing  policy,  holidays,  weekends,  cinema  quantity  profile  change  etc.  in  dynamics 

on  a  movie’s  USA  box  office  revenue.  We  study  some  interesting  cases  from  the  movie  box 

office history  and  concluded that for being  as  useful for the movie distributors as possible, the 

analysis  should  be  performed  in  dynamics  (for  instance,  the  collapse  of  The  Terimnal  (2004) 

movie, which is now included in the list of the best movies at kinopoisk, with very strong crew, 

significant production budget and comparable to other successful film projects in revenue during 

the first box office week: the significant impact from piracy content that emerged soon after its 

release  indicates  the  importance  of  dynamic  analysis).  In  contrast  to  the  previous  works  on 

related subjects discussed in the literature overview section,  we aim to  unite all the main ideas 

and  merits  that  were  point  out  there  (for  instance,  Google  search  volume  index  should  be 

included into the regressions because it increases the explanatory power of the model, searching 

costs of piracy matters and should be estimated,  model with an exponential decay may be used 

for  dynamic  box  office  revenue  investigations,  time  to  act  matters  etc.)  and  do  a  full-strength 

dynamic  investigation  on  the  large  database.  For  this  work  we  treated  and  collected  huge 

amounts  of  data.  These  are  the  main  steps,  which  we  performed  during  the  data  gathering 

process: 

 

Identification of the movies which were exposed on the US box office for the last 

10 years 

  Searching  and  processing  static  data  for  each  particular  movie  in  the  IMDb 

database 

  Star directors, actors and scriptwriters identification 

  Dynamic daily revenue data obtaining and handling 

  Public holiday identification;  

  Obtaining a piracy content information for the given movie using The Pirate Bay 

website and the VCDQ piracy log list  

  Piracy quality identification  

  Normalization of the movie name and obtaining the SVI data for the result of the 

normalization as a keyword; 

  Final data preparation for the regression analysis (clearing from a noise etc.)  

 

35 

As  a  result,  we  have  prepared  81787  daily  observations  in  total  for  1264  movies  for  the 

numerical  analysis;  we  have  built  a  dynamic  reduced-form  model  for  the  daily  stream  of  box 

office revenues and found a number of interesting empirical results. 

  The  effect  of  an  additional  cinema  of  box  office  revenues  is  highly  nonlinear  and 

statistically  different  form  zero,  which  implies  decrease-to-scale  function  between  the 

cinema quantity and the revenue 

 

 Calendar  effects  have  a  substantial  impact:  weekends  (Friday  Saturday  and  Sunday) 

increase  the  box  office  revenue  on  average  by  86%,  125%  and  79%  (where  Friday  and 

Saturday increases were proved to be statistically different). Public holiday increases the 

box office revenue by approximately 57% 

  Marketing  policy  (as  measured  by  prior  values  of  the  Google  Search  Volume  Index), 

which shapes the level of attention to the given movie, seems to have the highest effect 

on the future box office revenue within the span of one to 2 weeks. 

  The  impact  of  illegal  content  release  on  the  movie  box  office  revenue  depends  on  both 

the  quality  of  the  movie  (measured  by  the  IMDB  rating)  and  the  quality  of  the  pirated 

content itself. In particular, ceteris paribus, the availability of the low quality illegal copy 

of the movie decreases causes the structural jump of the daily box office revenue by 33% 

for  the  “bad”  movies  compared  with  only  26%  for  the  “good”  ones.  High  quality  copy 

has an effect of 52% and 33% respectively. We also establish that the difference between 

this numbers inside and between the groups is significant.  

  Availability of the illegal  content for an unsophisticated user (low searching  costs case) 

has an additional negative effect on the daily revenues and depends on the quality of the 

movie and the pirated file quality: we suggest that if a movie had already been stolen, the 

low  searching  website  monitoring  may  help  to  save  (more  precisely,  not  to  lose) 

20%(LQ) and 18%(HQ) for bad movies and 12%(LQ) and 18%(HQ) for good movies.

Ideas for further research 

 

In the light of our dynamic box office revenue analysis and the best dynamic movie strategy 

development,  we  would  like  to  discuss  the  main  points,  which  may  be  used  for  the  further 

investigations.  

First,  the  existing  analysis  could  be  extended  to  account  for  the  effect  of  substitution 

between the movies. It is obvious that for a given movie the box office revenue may be different 

when this movie is competing with different films-competitors, which are present on the cinema 

screens at the same time with the movie we tried to make as successful as possible (for instance, 

very often distributors decided to postpone the movie release because there is a very strong rival 

on the same or contiguous genre or which may pretend to the same awards that the movie under 

the management). For instance, a lot of prominent movie projects releases were postponed in the 

year 2003 because of the The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King box office start, which 

eventually  got  11  Oscar  awards  out  of  11  nominations.  But  it  is  also  clear  that  this  effect  may 

sometimes  help  a  movie  to  gain  more  money.  For  instance,  this  might  be  the  case  when  the 

presence of a strong competitor may push the viewers to go to the cinema, but in the cinema it 

might  appear  to  be  no  tickets  on  the  film  they  wanted,  which  could  possibly  compel  them  to 

watch a different movie (because they already reach the cinema and have an intention to go and 

watch at least something). Concerning the way this effect may be considered, for us it is an open-

ended question which seems to be not so obvious because here we should define precisely what 

film we note as a rival, how strong this rival is, how severe the effect of substitution between the 

film  considered  and  its  competitor  is  (especially  when  the  movie  released  with  genre  mixture) 

etc.  

Social  media  variables  may  be  also  included  into  the  dynamic  investigation  to  control  the 

word-of-mouth  effect, but  there are a lot of problems  using it,  which were pointed out  by  Lica 

and Tuta (2011) and discussed in the literature overview section. 

Moving  on,  the  main  research  target  of  the  scientists  working  in  this  field  should  be  a 

precise state-contingent market strategy, prescribing which static parameters of the movie should 

be chosen (star quantity, writer, director, MPAA rating, genre, runtime, budget etc.), at what date 

the movie should be released (contingent to the situation on the movie market), what should be 

the full cinema and advertisement profile for the given film (how many cinemas should we run 

each day and  what  should be  the advertisement  policy for the given movie,  again, contigent  to 

the  many  factors,  such  as  previous  revenues,  attention  to  the  movie  etc.)  and  the  full  piracy-

fighting plan with exact number and exact set of actions for each particular case (what should we 

monitor and how to act when the pirated content of the different quality will emerge, should we 

 

37 

bring  an  action  against  just  the  biggest  web  sites  with  low  searching  costs  (which  is  not  too 

cheap)  or  try  to  purify  the  internet  from  the  illegal  copy  of  the  content  we  distribute  (which  is 

even more expensive), how the cinema quantity profile and the marketing policy should change 

in  this  case  etc).  For  this  part  of  an  investigation  the  full  value  structural  model  should  be 

constructed. Furthermore,  the tools of the game theory  analysis may be useful  in  solving these 

problems and developing the full dynamic and state-contingent strategy.
