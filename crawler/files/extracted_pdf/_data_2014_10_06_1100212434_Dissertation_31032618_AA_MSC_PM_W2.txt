Abstract 

This  dissertation  is  an  attempt  to  shed  the  light  on  the  use  of  lean  principles  and 

tools  in  project  based  service  organization  and  their  potential  meaning  for  project 

management  in  terms  of  expanding  the  functions  of  current  methodology  of  project 

progress  and performance measurement.  In more detail, this is  an exploratory desk-based 

research  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  application  of  devised  methodology  of  measuring 

project  efficiency,  grounded  in  key  concepts  of  lean  manufacturing,  such  as  Overall 

Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), Waste identification and Value Stream Mapping (VSM). 

At  present,  numerous  successful  attempts  have  already  been  made  to  adopt  lean  thinking 

within  Project  Based  Organizations  (PBOs)  in  industries  ranging  from  management 

consulting  to  publishing  and  IT  companies  (Corbet,  2007).  However,  the  link  between 

technical  (operational)  management,  which  lean  is  primarily  aimed  at,  and  project 

management,  remains  indistinct.  In  other  words,  the  debates  continue  on  whether  lean 

principles and tools can lay in foundation of a purely management method. The results of 

the  study  elaborate  on  the  applicability  and  significance  of  the  learning  connected  with 

project performance measurement and provide project managers with a powerful extension 

of the Earned Value (EV) methodology.

1.  Introduction 

The  current  dissertation  is  aimed  at  providing  valuable  insights  for 

facilitating  the  learning  of  scholarly  and  practitioner  aspects  of  project 

management and establishing, therefore, a platform for development of the 

current  methodology  of  project  control  and  progress  performance 

measurement.  Apart  from  establishing  a  problem-solving  approach, 

overall, the research provides a vantage point for differentiation regarding 

the  management  practice 

in  knowledge-intensive  project  based 

organizations,  which  range  from  management  consultancy  to  software 

development  organizations.  In  my  viewpoint,  the  study  underlines  the 

specific  aspects  of  the  aforementioned  knowledge  areas  as  well  as  sheds 

light  onto  the  means  of  dealing  with  common  management  issues: 

schedule deviations, process efficiency losses, and increased project lead-

time.  

The  first  chapter  of  the  dissertation  is  devoted  to  developing 

research focus and background. Within this section, the topicality as well 

as  chief  research  aim  is  introduced.  Further,  I  articulate  the  main 

objectives  and  essential  research  questions  that  form  the  context  of  the 

investigation, which are also useful in defining the scope of the study. In 

conclusion of the section a brief description of methodology used and the 

structure of the study are provided. 

 

1.1. Research actuality and aim 

Nowadays,  the  concept  of  Lean  manufacturing  has  become  a 

synonym  for  high  productivity,  lower  cost  and  outstanding  quality. 

Notably,  this  philosophy  can  be  traced  back  to  1975  in  Toyota  motor 

company  in  Japan.  However  when  competitive  advantage  of  high  in 

productivity, flexibility and quality Japanese car manufacturing companies 

7 

 

 

 

became evident, leading American companies urged to study and adopt it. 

“The  machine  that  changed  the  world”  called  by  Womack  (1990) 

originally known as Toyota Production System (TPS), lean manufacturing 

is now a standard for more than a hundred of multinational assembly line 

giants,  among  which  are IBM,  Canon  Inc.,  Bayer,  General  Motors, 

Intel, Nike, Ford, Boeing, etc.

Even though lean philosophy is highly embedded in the automotive 

industry,  which,  of  course,  has  its  own  specific  characteristics  and 

limitations, the hard work of both management practitioners and scholarly 

thought  has  managed  to  extend  the  applicability  of  lean  methods  far 

beyond manufacturing, namely, to service industries. According to data of 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  for  2012,  service  industries  (non-

manufacturing)  account  for  on  average  63.6%  (IMF,  2012)  of  world`s 

gross domestic product (GDP), in which figures go as high as  about 80% 

(79.7%  United  States,  78.3%  United  Kingdom)  for  the  developed  and  up 

 

8 

 

 

to 65% for the emerging (Russia – 60,1%) countries (see Exhibit 1). Even 

though further in the  study  the heterogeneity  of  service industries  will be 

explored  in  more  detail,  at  this  point  it  is  important  to  note,  that  a 

proportion  of  this  percentage  is  generated  not  only  by  services  with 

repetitive  operations,  but  also by  contractual,  unique and  custom  services 

(projects). This statistical input suggests that: 

a)  The applicability of project management is spreading or already 

had  done  so  from  manufacturing  and  construction  projects 

towards  service 

industry  projects.  Many  service  sector 

companies operate through contracted work, which is associated 

with 

legal,  control  and  performance 

issues  (accounting, 

consulting,  market  research,  etc.).  In  such  context,  contrary  to 

management  of  operations,  “one  might  expect  to  find  greater 

emphasis on items related to the performance of the contract to 

include  scope  change  control  and  cost  control.  These  are 

precisely  the  areas  where  the  professional,  scientific,  and 

technical service organizations reported higher levels of project 

management  maturity”  (Grant  &  Pennypacker, 2006:  66). This 

highlights  the  definite  presence  of  project  management  in 

service context; 

b)  Partly  referenced  from  the  previous  point,  service  industries 

require  project  management  methods  that  can  warrant  the 

delivery  of  the  defined  contractually  service  (i.e.  project),  e.g. 

low  cost  and  quality  deviations  (Grant  &  Pennypacker,  2006). 

At the same time, service industry companies face the challenge 

of  operational  efficiency,  which  deals  with  the  need  for  high 

productivity  and  shorter  lead  times  (Damrath,  2012;  Bortolotti 

and  Romano, 2012) –  which falls in  line with  the  field of  lean 

management; 

 

9 

 

 

c)  High  competition 

in  service  sectors  requires  a  project 

management  approach  capable  of  remaining  effective  in 

turbulent multi-project environment (Hobday, 2000). 

The  aforementioned  preconditions  form  my  understanding  of  the 

relation between (1) service industry companies and project management, 

(2)  project  management  and  lean  management  fields  of  regulation  in 

service  context.  Furthermore,  an  approach,  combining  the  elements  of 

project management and lean management appears to be a logical conduct 

(from  the  premise  c),  which  can  be  defined  as  project  management 

methodology aimed at delivering a project with more value and less waste. 

A  waste  is  defined  as  an  activity  that  does  not  add  value  to  the  project 

from  the  viewpoint  of  either  external  (client  organization)  or  internal 

(contractor  employees,  project  managers,  etc.)  customers  (Arcidiacono  et 

al., 2012). There are certain waste types for every industry or service, for 

instance  in  project  management  this  might  be  creation  of  documentation, 

which  is  not  going  to  be  used  or  maintaining  overly  detailed  schedule 

(PMAW,  2012).    In  my  viewpoint,  “lean  project  management”  is  a  not 

merely  a  concept;  it  has  applied  nature  with  the  potential  of  project 

optimization, keeping in mind that a project is both unique and temporary 

(PMI,  2004),  facilitating  competitive  advantage  for  the  company,  which 

utilizes this approach.  

However,  when  a  service  requires  customization, 

i.e. 

it 

is 

characterized  by  low  repeatability  and  high  customer  involvement 

(Shemmer,  1986),  which  is  the  case  for  industries  like  management 

consulting,  accounting,  market  research,  software  development,  design, 

advertising,  legal  and  tax  advisory  and  so  on,  the  introduction  of  lean 

management  and  specifically  lean  project  management  becomes  a 

complicated endeavor. This particular cluster of service industries is often 

called  Project  Based  Organizations  (PBO)  (Hobday,  2000),  which 

 

10 

 

 

underpins  the  temporary  and  variable  nature  of  the  operations  –  the 

essence of a project (PMI, 2004) – required to create value.  

Specifically, the current research paper is aimed at developing such 

a methodological approach, which would allow project managers to define 

waste  and  numerically  measure  process  or  project  efficiency,  which,  in 

turn,  suggests  how  effective  company’s  project  management  is  and 

whether  project  decision-making  is  literate  in  terms  of  creating  value  for 

the  client.  Notably,  the  exploration  of  project  management  based  on  lean 

methods in PBO is yet poorly reflected in literature, which therefore makes 

this study a first step towards lean project management in service PBO.  

Although the need for project control and performance measurement 

differs from industry to industry depending, for instance, on utilization of 

non-reusable materials, in information intensive service industries the use 

of  project  control  loop  is  known  to  define  performance,  outcome  and, 

ultimately,  customer  experience of a service  (Upte  and  Goh, 2004).  This, 

due  to  imperative  character  of  the  customer  satisfaction  for  service 

industry  (Frei,  2006),  is  directly  related  to  project  success  (Osei-Bryson, 

2009).  

 

1.2.  Research scope, questions and objectives 

This  paragraph  deals  with  the  process  undertaken  to  achieve  the 

main aim of the study.  

As  the  research  aim  is  very  closely  connected  to  mapping  the 

current  state  of  firm’s  processes  as  well  as  numerical  indications  for 

establishing  process  efficiency,  the  closest  area  of  project  management 

knowledge  concerned  with  such  aspects  is  project  control.  Therefore,  the 

scope  of  the  paper  covers  the  use  of  classic  and  currently  most  used  and 

recognized project control methodology – Earned Value (EV) – as well as 

draws on  the  need  for  its  extension  which  utilizes  a non-monetary  aspect 

 

11 

 

 

of  value  or  waste  and  allows  to  perform  root  cause  analysis  of  major 

reasons  for  schedule  deviations.  This  conceptual  core,  achieved  by 

literature  review  of  lean  practices  and  methods  is  used  to  lay  the 

foundation of a new approach.  

The preamble inevitably leads to the palpitating scientific problem, 

verified by subsequent literature review:  

At present there is no methodological approach, suited to recognize 

and  measure  project  performance  and  indicate  the  prospects  for 

enhancing process efficiency; a worthwhile extension of Earned Value.  

The  articulation  of  the  problem  in  essence  draws  the  red  line  of 

dissertation scope:  

The study does not seek to develop either an integral organizational 

standards  of  project  management  or  application  of  lean  tools  related  to 

quality  management  –  the  core  problem  is  selection  and  justification  of 

lean methods that lie within applicability to project control and is suitable 

for diagnostic judgment of project progress and efficiency.  

This  argument  is  particularly  important  to  formulate  the  main 

hypothesis that drives research interest:  

A  number  of  approaches  at  the  intersection  of  lean  (technical) 

management and classical project management are misused and therefore 

the essential data about project performance may not inform management 

decisions. 

Nevertheless,  to  sharpen  the  research  focus,  a  number  of  research 

questions are posed and followed in a coherent and evolving manner:  

1. What  are  the  lean  management  tools  or  principles  and  which 

of them can be implemented in service industries?  

2. What is the essence of waste in service industries? 

3. What impact does implementation of lean thinking have on:  

a. Project Success?  

 

12 

 

 

b. Labor productivity?  

c. Work in progress (WIP)?  

4. What  are 

the  current  methods  of  measuring  project 

performance  and  why  lean  tools  can  be  used  to  form  a 

worthwhile extension?  

5. How  can  the  dynamic  diagnosis  of  lean-adopted  techniques 

inform project management decisions and what insights does it 

have for the way in which a PBO operates? 

The  study  seeks  to  address  these  questions  in  order  to  develop  a 

holistic  view  and  understanding  of 

the  problem 

topicality,  various 

methodologies  and  the  cluster  of  industries  for  which  these  methodologies 

are expected to bring about change in the way projects are managed. 

 

1.3. Paper methodology and structure 

For  the  purpose  of  achieving  the  primary  aim  of  the  study  in  a  a 

distinct and transparent manner, I outline the structure and methodology of 

the  study  according  to  Collis  &  Hussey  (2003),  who  offer  a  set  of 

classifications using the parameters of research:  

1)  Purpose; 

2)  Methodological approach; 

3)  Essence of application;  

4)  Philosophy.  

Each of the aforementioned aspects is clarified in further in detail.  

As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  I  regard  this  study  as  the  first 

step  towards  lean  project  management  in  service  companies  of  a  particular 

cluster  characterized  by  high  customization  of  operations.  In  the  following 

sections the thesis is supported by investigation of available literature, which 

is  rare  and  implicit  about  any  guidelines  of  such  applications.  This  point 

highlights  the  exploratory  purpose  of  the  paper,  which  seeks  to  test  a 

 

13 

 

 

hypothesis  on  specific  company  data,  forming  a  case  study,  rather  than 

providing  a  sufficient  statistical  validation  across  the  specific  industry  or 

industries.  The  generalization  at  this  point  is  consciously  sacrificed  to 

embark  on  use  of  proposed  approach  within  the  time  scale  available  for 

developing the master thesis. 

With  regard  to  methodological  approach,  essentially  both  qualitative 

and  quantitative  methods  have  drawbacks  and  advantages.  However,  the 

logic of lean methods as well as the data available for analysis constitutes a 

problem  that  can  only  be  solved  by  a  combination  of  the  two:  at  the  first 

stage,  the  nature  of  operational  outputs,  such  as  waste  and  value,  which  is 

less tangible in a PBO, has to be defined and interpreted; at the second stage, 

the  output  of  qualitative  analysis  serves  as  input  for  codification  of  data  in 

project-based dataset, that is further analyzed quantitatively.  

In  order  to  be  conclusive  both  in  terms  of  its  scientific  meaning  and 

pragmatic  application,  the  research  is  applied,  i.e.  as  mentioned  it  utilizes 

both primary and secondary data from a service PBO based in Russia. Even 

though statistically this investigation can present little interest for the general 

public  of  project  management  society,  I  believe  that  the  proposed 

methodology can impact companies at similar life-cycle stage in the settings 

of  emerging  countries  and  additionally  be  suitable  across  project-based 

industries.  

The  research  philosophy  stems  from  the  problem-solving  approach, 

selected  for  the  current  study  based  on  data  availability  as  well  as  few 

relevant  studies  conducted  in  similar  context.  For  the  most  part,  it  is 

positivistic  due  to  desk-based  essence,  as  it  adopts  the  approach  of  the 

natural sciences: a proposed methodology is based on the synthesis of theory 

an  previous  studies,  the  new  algorithm  is  followed  and  examined  in-depth, 

while the benefits of use are presented in an objective manner as inference of 

hypothesis  verification;  however 

it  also  has  classical  elements  of 

 

14 

 

 

phenomenological  approach, 

such  as 

illustrative  case 

study  and 

interpretations  of  interviews  with  company  experts  as  one  of  its  research 

methods. 

Following  the  prevalence  of  positivistic  philosophy,  the  research 

design is built around the three major parts:  

a) 

Theoretical  foundation  for the  applicability  of  lean  techniques 

within  management  of  service  organizations  and  PBO  in 

particular.  Within  this  section,  I  elaborate  on  the  fact  that  the 

scope  of  the  paper  is  intertwined  with  a  number  of  project 

management  fields  and  most  of  all  with  project  control.  In 

addition, I discuss the current lean methodology (Chapter 2);  

b) 

Empirical 

justification  of 

the  selected 

framework: 

the 

application  of  a  devised  algorithm  on  actual  PBO  data  and 

testing research hypothesis as well as discussing the output. In 

lean terms this part deals with mapping the current state of the 

investigated  scientific  problem  and  relying  on  the  results  of 

this inquiry (Chapter 3); 

c) 

Pragmatic  implications  and  recommendations  for  project 

managers  as  well  as  indication  of  adjacent  areas  for  future 

research (Chapter 4).  

The following chapter presents the critical review of relevant literature 

that  forms  a  conceptual  basis  of  the  study.  In  chapter  three  I  apply  the 

conceptual  model  to  the  data  gathered  from  both  primary  and  secondary 

sources,  while  in  chapter  four  the  results  of  this  investigation  are  used  as 

foundation for practical recommendations and directions of further research.

2.  Theoretical  foundation  of  Lean  Project  Management  and  its 

application in Service PBO 

2.1. Lean management: from manufacturing to service industry 

Unsurprisingly,  the  currently  observed  trend  of  lean  expansion  is 

somewhat similar to the chronology of its development in manufacturing, in 

which lean concept has undergone, first, emulation, and, decades later, after 

a  number  of  major  failures,  second  –  customization  and  localization 

(Womack et al., 1990).  

Since,  a  number  of  works  identify  the  transfer  of  lean  production 

techniques to service  industries of repetitive operations,  such  as healthcare, 

banking, food services, insurance, education, etc. in mid 90s and further on 

(Womack  &  Jones,  1996;  Kells,  1995;  Swank,  2003;  Radnor  &  Boaden, 

2008).  These  and  alike  industries  have  a  lot  in  common  with  service-

oriented  retail  companies  (Kollberg  et  all.,  (2007);  Swank  2003).  A  case 

study by McKinsey & Company (Coxon et. al., 2011) is a clear example, in 

which  the  application  of  lean  principles  in  banking  has  brought  about 

significant  positive  changes  (see  Exhibit  1,  Appendix  A).  The  same  source 

suggests  a  number  of  ambitious  improvements  made  for  Royal  Bank  of 

Scotland, BNP Paribas and The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 

Telecommunication (SWIFT). 

The first step of this study is to evaluate its principles and tools from 

the viewpoint of project management. In the second step of literature review, 

I  outline  the  logic  of  application  of  lean  thinking  in  service  industries, 

reflecting current challenges, cases and impact on performance, elaborating 

on  the  characteristics  of  target  industry  and  objective  limitations  of  lean 

tools, which can nevertheless be effectively applied to measure and manage 

projects.  In  conclusion,  I  form  a  specific  framework  that  is  based  on 

 

16 

 

 

applicability  of  selected  lean  tools,  which,  if  used  in  complex  on  regular 

basis, can serve as a project management method, particularly in the area of 

project control. 

 

2.1.1.  Lean concepts in support of project control 

In the review of basic elements of lean production, it seems relevant to 

mention  that  in  lean,  except  for  philosophy  and  culture,  the  main 

improvements  are  carried  out  at  process  level,  which  falls  into  the  field  of 

regulation  of  project  management  (George  et  al.,  2003).  The  summary  of 

key  principles  of  lean,  taken  from  Andersson  et  al.  (2006),  is  provided  in 

Table  1  (Appendix  A).  Ahlström  (2004)  defines  a  7-principle  model,  in 

which there are notable extensions: elimination of waste, decentralization of 

responsibility and vertical information systems (IS). Each of these additional 

elements,  combined  with  the  classic  principles  of  lean  thinking,  provides 

fruitful  basis  for the framework  offered further in  the study  for  the  reasons 

described below. 

In  project  management  literature  project  control  is  seen  as  a  tool  to 

optimize  (a)  employee  behavior  to  achieve  organizational  goals  (Flamholtz 

et  al.,  1985),  (b)  project  performance  through  user  contribution  (Liu  et  al., 

2010).  These  aspects  contribute  to  the  effective  management  of  projects 

through their lifecycles (Bernroider and Ivanov, 2010), i.e. lead times, which 

is one of the core metrics in use of lean management. These aspects bridge 

yet another gap between project management and lean management: (a) and 

(b) highlight the role of decentralization and standardization of activities as 

the  need,  which  comes  from  within  project  management.  Both  aspects 

contribute to elimination of waste at process level.  

In  more  detail,  elimination  of  waste  denotes  that  in  product  creation 

lifecycle everything that does not add value to the product, service or, in our 

case,  project  should  be  excluded  (Monden,  1983).  The  notable  exception 

 

17 

 

 

from  the  list  of  potential  wastes  is  business  activities,  which  are 

indispensable  strategically  for  operations,  although  still  are  to  be  kept  at 

minimum  in  total  proportion  of  activities  (Arcidiacono  et  al.,  2012).  For 

instance, a template for project report or new software to operate tasks may 

not directly add value to the project, but is vital for future success.  

The aspect of decentralization is developed to push the responsibility 

down  to  the  level  of  project  employees  (Hayes,  Wheelwright  and  Clark, 

1988).  Conceptually,  lean  settings  require  a  transfer  to  flat  organization 

(Gunn,  1987),  so  that  cell  employees  or  project  team  in  many  cases  has 

shared  responsibility  versus  the  imposed  control  by  project  manager. 

Leonard-Barton (1992) calls this step a must to avoid micromanagement at 

process level and concentrate on actual problem solving.  

The role of vertical IS consists in “relying on direct information flows 

to  the  relevant  decision  makers”  (Ahlstrom,  2004),  which  combined  with 

shared responsibility of project team allows to update an IS and actually use 

the  system 

to 

increase  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  managers’ 

performance, observed by Raymond & Bergeron (2008). 

 

2.1.2.  Analytical tools 

A  number  of  tools are  displayed  in  Exhibit  2 (Appendix  A), adopted 

from  Broughton  (2012),  the  most  general  ones  are  briefly  reviewed  due  to 

poor suitability to the framework developed in this study (Table 2, Appendix 

A).  However,  stemming  from  the  study  on  maturity  of  project  control  in 

both  manufacturing  and  professional  service  organizations  (Grant  & 

Pennypacker,  2006:  67),  a  number  of  tools  are  considered  to  suit  the 

definition  of  the  top  level  control  mechanisms,  which  reads  as  “an 

improvement process is in place to continuously improve resource planning, 

schedule  definition  and  cost  control  processes”.  Notably,  this  is  a  project 

 

18 

 

 

management  framework  that  utilizes  one  of  the  key  elements  of  lean: 

continuous improvement or “kaizen”. 

  Value Stream Mapping 

The  bottleneck  of  this  approach  is  that  the  essence  of  projects: 

temporality and uniqueness (PMI, 2008), which highlights the fact that only 

one state can be captured. Nevertheless, as for PBO projects are the primary 

business  mechanism  for  coordinating  and  integrating  all  the  main  business 

functions of the firm (Hobday, 2000), there is a high possibility of repetitive 

elements,  i.e.  wastes,  across  projects.  VSM  then  can  be  used  to  assess  the 

repetitive  elements  among  the  projects  at  process  or  activity  level  and 

continuously update waste logs, after which project management can easily 

identify common waste types, locations at which they occur and dispose of 

the underlying reasons for their occurrence.  

  Standardization of work 

Standard  work  refers  to  standardizing  the  operations  as  well  as 

operation  sequences  (Damrath,  2012).  Standardization  of  procedures  in 

project  management  is  highly  important,  especially  in  the  field  of  project 

control.  Nidumolu  (1996)  advocates  this  statement:  “…increases  in  the 

standardization  were  directly  associated  with  decreases  in  the  residual 

performance  risk,  defined  as  the  extent  of  difficulty  in  estimating 

performance  outcomes  during  the  later  stages  of  the  project”  (Nidumolu, 

1996:135).  Data  collection  on  project  performance  in  particular  requires 

highly  standardized  forms  (or  spreadsheets)  with  data  to  be  filled  each  day 

of  project  work,  to  estimate,  for  instance,  earned  value  (EV)  up  to  current 

time  period (Hanna, 2012).  In the devised  framework standardization plays 

important role of reducing the volume of non-value added activities. 

  Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) 

The key tool at this section is Overall Equipment Efficiency, which is 

OEE  is  “a  quantification  of  how  efficiently  and  effectively  a  company 

 

19 

 

 

performs compared to its designed capacity, during its scheduled run time” 

(Zuashkiani et al., 2011). This source suggests that this tool has already been 

applied  for  performance  improvement  in  asset  management,  which  is  non-

manufacturing context. This is highly important in underpinning the decision 

points  for  project  managers.  For  instance,  if  a  certain  waste  type,  which 

drives  a  performance  loss  across  several  projects  and  has  been  observed  in 

project history, causes a negative deviation of 10%, this may reflect the need 

to restructure the process to exclude such loss from the value chain.  

Initial evaluation has demonstrated that the contents of lean principles 

and some of its analytical tools  form a fruitful background for a transfer of 

various aspects to project management. These isolated points will be united 

in section 2.3, in which I attempt to develop an integral framework suitable 

for project control, the basis for lean project management.  

 

2.2.  Antecedents for application in service industry 

Unsurprisingly,  project  management  literature  remains  rather  scant  in 

application  of  lean  principles;  there  are  few  examples  in  the  field  of 

scheduling  (Lee  et  al.,  2007),  generic  philosophy  of  application  to  project 

management  (Gabriel,  1997);  the  rest  of  case  studies  pays  close  attention  to 

particular projects and performance measurement, such as in construction (Yu 

et  al.,  2009),  software  development  (Middleton  and  Joyce,  2012),  supply 

chain (Arif-Uz-Zaman, & Ahsan, 2014) etc., which at the moment cannot be 

aggregated  or  generalized  for  wide  use  in  project  management  community. 

Even  though  there  are  plenty  of  reasons  behind  application  of  technological 

solutions offered by lean production principles, at the moment the majority of 

case  studies  relate  to  healthcare,  financial  services,  IT,  insurance  and  other 

service industries of repetitive operations (Wei, 2009).  

The  introduction  of  lean  principles  to  service  industry  begins  with 

recognition  of  the  fact,  that  service  products  differ  from  manufacturing 

 

20 

 

 

products, although not that dramatically to forbid application of lean tools, “if 

some peculiarities of the sector are taken into account” (Bortolotti & Romano, 

2012:  514).  Furthermore,  Ahlström  (2004)  refers  to  cases  in  which  the 

essence  of  services  is  fundamentally  more  suitable  for  lean  practices  than 

manufacturing.  The  followers  of  this  view  concentrate  on  different  aspects 

and  types  of  service  companies,  for  instance  Allway  and  Cobertt    (2002) 

examine the meaning of alignment of processes and activities to client value 

creation  in  consultancy  services,  Dahlgaard  and  Dahlgaard-Park  (2006) 

explore the proportion of NVA activities in total volume of  activities (which 

turns out to be 74%). 

 

2.2.1.  Definition of a service 

First,  it  is  necessary  to  highlight  the  specific  nature  of  services  in 

order  to  be  clear  with  further  industry  classifications.  One  of  the  notable 

definitions of a service comes from Haksever et al. (2000:3), who view them 

as  “economic  activities  that  produce  time,  place,  form,  or  psychological 

utilities”.  To  demonstrate  this  further,  authors  introduce  an  example  of  a 

consulting firm, which assembles all the necessary information in the form, 

suitable  for  a  manager  to  make  a  decision.  According  to  this  definition, 

project  management  itself  can  be  viewed  as  a  service.  Since  there  is  a 

principal analytical difference between goods and services, it seems relevant 

to  propose  that  management  of  these  entities  differs  as  well.  The 

characteristics  of  services  (Table  4,  Appendix  A)  are  taken  into  account 

further  to  establish  management  aspects  of  service  delivery  as  an  output 

product  of  project  management  in  particular  types  of  service  industries, 

described in the next section. 

 

2.2.2.  Lean Service: cases and impact on performance 

 

21 

 

 

As  stated,  lean  principles  have  been  widely  applied  to  service 

industry.  Most  of  the  cases  focus  on  improvements  in  productivity,  costs, 

waste elimination, reduction of WIP  and quality  deviations. The  full  list of 

publications on particular industry adopted from literature review of Suarez-

Barraza et al. (2012) can be found in Appendix A (Exhibit 4).  

The pioneering sector, in  which  lean  principles have been  applied, is 

healthcare.  The  first  indications  of  such  possibilities  are  summarized  by 

Womack and Jones (1996), improvements in management and time savings 

are outlined by Jones & Mitchell (2006) and Lipley (2008). Commenting the 

findings of Kollberg, Dahlgaard, and Brehmer (2007), Suarez-Barraza et al., 

(2012) notes: “Lean Service was considered as one element that formed part 

of  an  overall  management  plan  to  change the  mentality  and  the  daily  work 

performed  by  health-care  centers”,  which  highlights  the  changes  related  to 

particularly  management aspect of operations. There are other  management 

examples, which are facilitated by lean projects, for instance Dahlgaard et al. 

(2011)  proposed  self-assessment  framework  (ILL),  which  turned  out  to  be 

valid  in  identification  of  organizational  bottlenecks.  In  general,  primary 

target  of  lean  transformation  projects  in  this  sector  are  inadequate 

procedures  and  bureaucratic  processes,  which  decrease  the  quality  and  rate 

of customers served per shift (Collins & Muthusamy, 2007).  

Another  sector,  in  which  lean  principles  turned  out  to  be  highly 

applicable,  is  education.  The  majority  of  studies  (Dahlgaard  et  al.,  (1995); 

Kells, 1995; Suarez-Barraza et al., 2012) indicate that main improvements in 

this  sector  relate  to  Total  Quality  Management  (TQM)  and  waste 

elimination.  Again,  the  restructuring  of  processes  based  on  information 

flows, provided by lean analytical tools, “helped to improve the management 

of services” (Suarez-Barraza et al., 2012: 370).  

As  indicated  in  introduction,  financial  and  banking  sectors  also  fall 

into the sphere of transfer to lean management. Swank (2003) elaborated on 

 

22 

 

 

the  result  of  process  redesign  as  “surprising”  due  to  decrease  at  26%  in 

labour  costs  and  40%  in  costs  related  to  errors,  rework  and  corrections.  A 

study  of  global  investment  bank  by  Coxon  et  al.,  (2011)  has  shown  an 

increase in productivity by 50%, while the volume of documents with errors 

reduced by 40%.  

Significantly  less  academic  papers  can  be  found  about  airlines, 

restaurant and hotel services. The commonality between these industries is 

high  process  repetitiveness  and  high  customer  interaction.  The  practitioner 

studies  of  application  of  lean  principles  to  restructure  and  reorganize 

processes  in  airline  industry  (Greenwood  et  al.,  2002;  Reinhardt,  2007) 

enumerate savings and reduction of lead times, while Suarez-Barraza (2008) 

reports on reduction of operating costs, client-response time and the quality 

of service in hotels and restaurants.  

 

 

2.2.3.  Differentiating among service industries 

Given  the  specifics  of  a  service  as  an  output  product  of  a  cluster  of 

industries,  it  is  vital  to  define  these  segments,  explore  the  extent  of  lean 

spread  within  them  and  establish  target  industry.  As  described  in  the 

methodological  introduction  to  the  study,  service  sectors  can  be  clustered 

based  on  repeatability  of  processes  and  customer  involvement.  Schemmer 

(1986)  first  proposed  a  matrix  with  these  dimensions,  which  incorporate 

common problems during service production and delivery. The dimension of 

repeatability refers to common stages and processes, rather than activity level, 

while  customer  involvement  stands  for  the  frequency  of  interaction  with 

external  customers  (Damrath,  2012).  Even  though  this  framework  is  simple 

and  plain  in  contents,  it  allows  investigate  the  spread  of  lean  principles  by 

gradations and define the industry of interest (see Exhibit 2). 

 

 

23 

 

 

Exhibit 2. Service industry matrix (based on Bicheno, 2008) 

 

Even  though  in  reality  the  boundaries  between  formulated  categories 

can be fuzzy, four distinct clusters can be characterized (Damrath, 2012). The 

detailed description is provided in Table 3, Appendix A). 

The  overview  of  cases  on  application  of  lean  principles  in  service 

industries  (section  2.2.2)  has  shown,  that  practically  every  sector  has  been 

attempted to transfer to lean, except for the custom one, characterized by high 

customer  interaction  and  low  repeatability,  which  forms  a  direct  link  to 

project  work  and  PBO.  This  is  one  of  the  primary  reasons  why  it  has  been 

chosen  to  concentrate  on  companies  operating  in  this  gradation,  especially 

with regard to potential positive outcomes for management of projects.  

 

 

 

 

24 

 

 

2.2.4.  Challenges for the custom cluster 

As  described,  the  custom  cluster  has  low  repeatability  of  operations 

(high  uniqueness)  and  higher  customer 

interaction,  which  provides 

connection  with  project  work  (PMI, 2004).  One  of  the  main  challenges  for 

custom service sector is to follow the footpath of manufacturing in terms of 

reduced  project  lifecycles  (Damrath,  2012).  As  a  result  of  increasing 

competition in service industry in general with high rates of innovation and 

know-how,  faster  response  to  market  conditions  and  management  of 

operations  is  required  by  service  business  models  and  processes  (Sellitto, 

Borchardt,  &  Pereira,  2003).    According  to  Upte  and  Goh  (2004),  who 

investigated  management  aspects  of  lean  in  information  intensive  service 

industries,  such  as  mentioned  contract  working  management  consulting, 

accounting, market research and other PBO, the processes could be managed 

with the tools, which are applicable to manufacturing processes (particularly 

bottleneck  identification  and  cycle  time  analysis).  However  another  aspect 

of information intensive services remains unnoticed: feedback control loop, 

which denotes  that  generated information  is suitable  for  “the  measurement, 

monitoring,  and  control  of  process  performance.  …The  efficiency  and  the 

effectiveness  of 

information  processing 

activities 

in 

collection, 

transformation, storage, use and dissemination of information determine the 

ultimate performance and outcome of such services” (Upte and Goh, 2004: 

493).   

Another argument for the use of information generated within projects 

of service organization to manage operations is voiced in the study published 

by  Ahlstrom  (1998),  in  which  author  insists  on  constant  monitoring  of 

processes  using  relevant  metrics.  In  absence  of  such  tools  processes  can 

degrade  and  decrease  customer  satisfaction.  Yassine  et  al.  (2004)  suggests 

that  a  technique  that  uses  workflow  data  can  be  widely  used  to  manage  a 

process.  Bortolotti  and  Romano  (2012)  consider  this  proposition  “useful  to 

 

25 

 

 

improve  efficiency  and  lead  time  performances  with  faster  information 

exchanges,  faster  task  execution  and  concurrency  of  tasks”  (Bortolotti  and 

Romano, 2012: 519). 

Overall, these arguments suggest, that perhaps the main management 

challenge  for  many  organizations  in  custom  cluster  of  service  sector  is 

meaningful  data  for  sufficient  decision-making  regarding  process  structure 

and  value  creation  stream  (Damrath,  2012).  At  the  moment  scholarly 

literature  (George,  2003)  suggests  the  impossibility  to  verify  the  quality  or 

speed of processing in any other metric, except for actual time to complete 

the  task  (or  cost),  while  any  other  indicator  can  be  referred  as  judgmental 

and  subjective.  However  many  companies  do  not  manage  their  processes 

with  regard  to  quality  or  processing  speed  even  using  this  metric;  rare 

examples  of  managing  these  two  parameters  include  excel  spreadsheets 

(Archibald,  1992).  The  need  for  project  management  technique  (since 

projects  are  the  primary  form  of  business  operation  for  companies  of  this 

sector (Hobday, 2000)), which can cope with the challenge of combination, 

analytics, dissemination  of  workflow  information  in  a  clear,  accessible  and 

understandable way is evident. Upte and Goh (2004) back up this suggestion 

with  the  proposition  of  relevant  metric  -  the cycle time for completion of a 

service  request,  i.e.  contractually  defined  project.  A  related  study  by 

Blackburn (1991) indicated, for service companies at that time about 90% of 

cycle time is occupied by first and most dangerous waste described in lean 

principles – waiting time. 

The  important  preconditions  for  adopting  lean  techniques  in  project 

control, which would operate with the mentioned indicators - elimination of 

certain  wastes  types  and  consequent  cycle  time  reduction  –  are  set  by  the 

synthesis of practitioners’ cases and scholarly arguments above. One of the 

resulting  definitions  of  a  service  suggests  that  customer  experience  is  as 

important as the output product itself. Frei (2006) suggests that this point in 

 

26 

 

 

application  of  lean  techniques  is  of  utmost  importance,  as  the  increase  in 

process  efficiency  can  discard  customer  satisfaction,  which  in  long-term 

may  offset  any  discrete  competitive  advantage,  profit  or  market  share  (see 

Bortolotti and Romano, 2012). Some scholars insist on VSM being the most 

important lean tool to adopt in service sector (Piercy and Rich, 2009). 

 

2.3.  Towards lean project management: framework of the study 

The scope of the framework developed in the study is closely related 

to the field of project control and project performance measurement, defined 

as  the  aggregate  identification  of  process  efficiency.  Even  though  the 

debates  over  the  optimal  control  mechanisms  of  projects  is  still  ongoing, 

some authors readily confirm that the use of “iron-triangle” paradigm is no 

longer viable (Atkinson, 1999; Shenhar et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2005; Barclay 

and  Osei-Bryson,  2009).  The  alternatives  suggested  to  overcome  the 

restrictions  of  classic  methods  of  project  control  (such  as  critical  success 

factors  (CSF),  key  performance  indicators  (KPI))  are  considered  to  be 

concentrated on either side of value definition (Yu et al., 2005; Barclay and 

Osei-Bryson,  2009).  This  aspect  is  somewhat  common  between  project 

management and lean schools of thought.  

The  project  management  idea  of  value  differs  from  the  business 

(economic)  definition  and  consists  in  an  allocation  of  project  budget  often 

expressed  in  currency  or  time.  The  tool  aimed  at  control  and  estimation  of 

project  performance  is  most  often  earned  value  (Yu  et  al.,  2005;  Cioffi, 

2006;  Lauras  et  al.,  2009).  A  number  of  significant  additions  have  been 

made as for the EV methodology and other monitoring tools, some of which 

sought to either extend the parameters of “iron triangle” or reduce them (see 

Khosrowshahi. 1997; Shenhar et al., 2001; Lipke 2003), however the overall 

approach  remained  mainstream  comparison  of  budget  to  actual  cost  of 

activities. This school of thought also learned to distinguish between project 

 

27 

 

 

management  success,  project  success  and  output  product  success  as 

important  dimensions  of  project  performance  measurement  (PPM)  (see 

Exhibit  3,  adopted  from  Barclay  and  Osei-Bryson  (2009)).    These  aspects 

are developed further in sections 2.3.1. and 2.3.2. 

 

Exhibit  3.  Project  Performance  Measurement  dimensions  (Barclay  and 

Osei-Bryson, 2009) 

 

Since projects are temporary and unique activities that result in a new 

product or service (APM, 2006; PMI, 2004) a transfer of lean thinking from 

lean  service  examples,  discussed  earlier  with  particularly  management 

ability to diagnose process efficiency and restructure processes as a result of 

such  diagnosis,  project  management  as  a  science  may  well  be  subject  to 

intervention for some tools from manufacturing and service sectors (section 

2.3.3.)  There  are  numerous  examples  of  lean  techniques  that  were  used  in 

transformation  projects  of  both  manufacturing  (Boeing,  Alcoa)  and  service 

sector,  however  these  techniques  and  methodologies  were  primarily 

considered as objects (or facilities) of change, while there are still no scholar 

or  practitioner  suggestions  that  they  have  become  a  project  management 

methodology (i.e. subject of change). 

 

28 

 

 

In  my  study,  I  refer  to  project  based  organizations  (PBO)  as  perfect 

settings for such transfer due to, first, their prevalence in custom cluster, but 

also because of: 

a)  Multi-project  environment,  in  which  single  projects  compete  for 

organizational resources (Frinsdorf et al., 2014); 

b)  Difficulties arising from poor operationalization of value and/or 

waste within particular projects and numerical measurement of these 

parameters; 

c)  The difficulty of attributing performance attributes (e.g. flexibility, 

effectiveness,  efficiency  and  return  on  investment)  to  particular 

factors such as organizational form (e.g. PBO) or industry-specific 

forms  of  projects,  rather  than  other  factors  (e.g.  project  team, 

stakeholder management, company culture, etc.) (Hobday, 2000) 

One  of  the  main  reasons  for  adoption  of  lean  principles  in  custom 

cluster  is  that  the  function  of  performance  measurement  is  not  only  in 

monitoring,  but  also  in  learning  and  improvement  (Wegelius-Lehtonen, 

2001). Project-based structure of many companies in custom sector perfectly 

allow  this  idea  to  proliferate  in  business  processes  and  PPM  tools, 

accompanied  by  knowledge  collection  and  distribution  mechanisms  in  the 

form of information systems (IS) (section 2.3.5).  

 

2.3.1.  Earned value 

At  the  moment,  the  area  of  project  control  has  only  one  widely 

utilized 

tool  for 

tracking  project  performance, 

the  Earned  Value 

(EV)(Pajares and Lopez-Paredez, 2011). The tool was introduced in late 60th 

and since a number of amendments, such as Earned Schedule (Lipke, 2003, 

2004),  had  been  made,  a  lot  more  provide  an  estimation  of  tool  accuracy 

(Vandevoorde and Vanhoucke, 2006, 2007; Lipke et al., 2009). Notably, the 

EV methodology has numerous benefits and I by no means suggest that it is 

 

29 

 

 

either  outdated  or  inappropriate,  however  it  has  not  been  tailored  to  any 

specific  industry  except  US  military  service,  which  is  the  birthplace  of  the 

method.  

The  method  uses  three  estimates  of  costs  –  budgeted,  actual  and 

scheduled to measure how much value should have been earned (or, rather, 

how  much  should  have  been  spent)  at  the  moment  of  measurement.  High 

tool  validity  is  assured  by  its  forecasting  power  regarding  budget  cost  at 

completion  with  current  dynamics  and  underpinning  of  time-dependent 

deviations. At the same time, the universal character of this tool has led to a 

number of drawbacks, among which are: 

  Voluntary  root-cause  analysis  (RCA)  of  reasons  behind 

deviations; 

  No  iterative  approach  to  scheduled  and  budgeted  costs  (i.e.  no 

optimality check of resource allocation); 

  Misleading indictors (SPI and SV) towards the final third of the 

project (Lipke, 2003). 

The  aforementioned  extensions  of  EV,  such  as  Earned  Schedule  or 

fine-tuning  of  accuracy  have  mended  some  of  the  calculation  problems 

(third  aspect),  however  first  two  aspects  at  the  moment  are  left  without 

common problem-solving approach.  

Using  suggestions  of  Seddon  &  Caulkin  (2007)  and  Piercy  &  Rich 

(2009)  to  mend  these  problems,  I  will  use  the  two  lean  tools,  which  are 

specifically aimed at resolving first and to some extend second drawbacks of 

EV: Value Stream Analysis and Waste identification. 

 

2.3.2.  Relation to project and project management success 

Since relation to project success is one of the key metrics developed in 

PPM  over  the  years  (Osei-Bryson,  2009),  the  conceptual  framework  of  the 

study  has  to  conceptually  tight  the  aim  of  the  study  (project  management 

 

30 

 

 

success)  with  overall  success  of  the  project.  I  will  define  the  two  concepts 

first: 

  Project success  – long-term utilization of the project outcome, which 

enables  a  business  or  enterprise  to  meet  wider  goals  (Munns  & 

Bjermi, 1996; Turner & Serrador, 2014); 

  Project  management  success  –  planning  and  control  (preferably, 

quantifiable) of  the project, concerned  with  on-time  delivery,  within-

budget expenditures and appropriate performance standards (Munns & 

Bjeirmi, 1997). 

Classic  studies  on  this  subject, for  instance  Munns  &  Bjermi  (1997), 

Belassi  &  Tukel  (1996),  suggest  that  project  management  alone  cannot 

define  project  success.  However  there  is  evidence  that  good  project 

management  allows  avoiding  project  failure.  The  same  sources  denote  that 

higher  customer  involvement  “in  planning  and  production  phases”  helps  to 

meet wider objectives, i.e. also influence project success.  

Additionally, project management  considers traditional  parameters of 

projects,  i.e.  time,  cost  and  quality  (PMI,  2004),  while  project  success 

highlights  objectives  of  project  stakeholders  (Cooke  -  Davies,  2002).  The 

combination of the two sets of criteria is believed to be suitable for improved 

analysis of project performance and considered as guidance pulled from the 

literature (Osei-Bryson, 2009). 

Notably, lean perspective helps to develop such a combination due to 

its  orientation  on  “voice  of  the  customer”  (Griffin  and  Hauser,  1993)  or 

“customer  perspective”  (Kaplan  and  Norton,  2004).  It  appears  that 

customer/stakeholder 

requirements  develop 

the  understanding  of 

value/waste  on  the  level that controls  for key  “iron-triangle”  parameters on 

condition that they are suited to create customer satisfaction. In the papers, 

which discuss Lean Service cases, there is often no mention of whether the 

project outcome is success or failure, however using logical deduction from 

 

31 

 

 

generous increase in productivity, reduction of lead times, cost effectiveness, 

etc., it is evident that either the majority or all the stakeholder requirements 

lead  to  customer  satisfaction.  Additionally,  the  voice  of  the  customer  can 

come  both  from  inside  and  outside  the  project  or  organization.  Therefore, 

principles  (1)  and  (2)  in  Table  1  (Appendix  A),  are  the  primary  elements, 

which are used in conceptual framework of the study.  

 

2.3.3.  Process  efficiency  and  value  stream:  towards  effective  Project 

Management 

Methodologically,  the  framework  of  the  current  study  is  aimed  at 

providing  an  approach  assembled  from  lean  tools  suited  to  diagnose  process 

efficiency using practically the same inputs as used in EV methodology. The 

main difference, however, as described in section 2.3.1.. is that  my approach 

allows to highlight the bottlenecks of processes, which facilitates action-based 

improvements.  

Process  efficiency,  if  separately  considered,  consists  in  meeting  time, 

cost  and  scope  goals  by  optimal  utilization  of  capital,  material  and  human 

resources  (Frinsdorf,  2014;  Turner  &  Serrador,  2014)  and  is  an  object  of 

technical  construction  of  a  process,  which  cannot  be  considered  a  project 

management method. However, if the input for such tool comes from project 

stakeholders,  and  the  tool  itself  is  used  primarily  to  control  the  planned 

resources (the way EV does), then this newborn method becomes suitable for: 

  Project control; 

  Performance  measurement  (planned  vs.  actual 

time,  products, 

resources spent on tasks); 

  Optimization (elimination of non-value-added activities). 

The  proposed  methodology  consists  in  application  of  Value  Stream 

Analysis,  which,  in  essence,  allows  more  transparency  in  value  creation 

process. Exhibit 5 (Appendix A) shows that there are two basic characteristics 

 

32 

 

 

of processes: total lead-time and value added time (a ladder in the bottom of 

the  picture, see  the  full  list  of  abbreviations  in  Exhibit  6,  Appendix  A).  The 

visual  map  of  processes  allows  identifying  certain  waste  types,  which 

immediately  informs  management  decisions  on  restructuring  a  business 

process,  therefore  reducing  lead-time  and  increasing  value-added  time.  The 

necessary  comparison  of  these  indicators  among  projects  by  means  of 

calculation  OEE  helps  to  see  the  overall  process  efficiency  level  across 

different projects. 

The  incorporation  of  such  tool  in  the  process  of  project  control  and 

performance  measurement  will  allow  projects 

to  be  managed  more 

effectively, i.e. doing the right things, selecting and focusing on producing an 

output that there is a demand for (Sundqvist et al., 2014). 

 

2.3.4.  Management and learning aspects of proposed approach 

The  proposed  framework  (Exhibit  4,  section  3.1)  is  aimed  at  one  of 

the  most  basic  forms  of  management  as  a  science  –  control.  Importantly, 

project control allows using lean principles to holistically scrutinize the root 

causes  of  process  inefficiencies,  which  means  that  this  is  jointly  a  tool  for 

optimization.  One  of  the  main  suggested  outcomes  is  that  management 

decisions should be aimed at not only monitoring the current state, but also 

at  developing  a  more  efficient  high  value-added  processes  by  means  of 

reduction  of  lead  times  (Bortolotti  and  Romano,  2012).  This  means,  that 

streamlined  activities  that  drive  value  and  exclude  waste  shorten  the  time 

required to complete a service request, i.e. a project. In turn, this means that 

a  PBO  can  process  more  projects  at  a  time  period  without  any  detrimental 

effects  to  project  quality,  which  is  in  line  with  the  constant  strive  for 

competitive advantage between project organizations (Lindkwist, 2008). 

In  such  circumstances,  there  are  some  characteristics  of  services  that 

can  cause  negative  deviations  in  project  performance,  for  instance 

 

33 

 

 

homogeneity  in  IHIP  framework  (Table  4,  Appendix  A)  denotes,  that 

deviations  in  performance  depend  on  human  operator.  Another  negative 

affect  can  be  drawn  from  perishability  of  services  in  the  way  that  a 

completed request has to be somehow reflected, depicted, and systematized 

in order for organization to be able to refer to it when needed.  

The  answer  to  these  as  well  as  other  specifics  of  service  industry  is 

organizational  learning.  A  recent  study  by  Pemsel  &  Wiewiora  (2012) 

concludes,  “PBO  has  to  ensure  effective  knowledge  sharing  (KS)  and 

integration within and between projects to avoid the risk of reinventing the 

wheel  and  so  repeating  the  same  mistakes“(also  noted  in  Schindler  and 

Eppler,  2003).  Project-based  learning  is  commonly  referred  to  as  1)  the 

creation  and  acquisition  of  knowledge  generated  within  the  project,  and  2) 

the  codification  and  transfer  of  knowledge  (Scarbrough  et  al.,  2004). 

Undoubtedly,  project-based 

learning  has 

to  be 

institutionalized, 

i.e. 

transferred  into  a  continuous  process,  which  would  allow  a  PBO  to 

constantly evolve in their practice. In doing so, an organization would have 

to transform or even create from a scratch the mechanisms of codification in 

a  most  simple,  reliable  and  accessible  way.  Essentially,  the  use  of 

knowledge  or  information  systems  is  one  of  the  preconditions  for  adopting 

lean methodology (see section 2.1.2), and many scholars already emphasized 

the  need  for  project  learning  in  the  process  of  control  and  monitoring 

(Wegelius-Lehtonen, 2001; Upte and Goh, 2004; Ahlstrom, 2004; Raymond 

& Bergeron, 2008). 

The  next  chapter  of  the  study  is  aimed  at  providing  empirical 

justification  of  the  proposed  framework, testing  the basic  hypothesis  of  the 

study (section 1.2).

3.  Mapping 

the  current  state:  empirical 

justification  of 

proposed methodology 

Theoretical overview of the key concepts of the research, case studies 

on  the  use  of  lean  in  service  industries, drawbacks  of  current  methodology 

and  the  challenges  faced  by  a  PBO  in  the  custom  cluster  has  narrowed  the 

need  for  improvement  and  optimization  down  to  the  project  management 

methodology  with  elements of lean. The evidence  of both  the need  for and 

absence  of  methodology,  suited  to  perform  the  two  functions  of  project 

control  and  project  performance  measurement,  has  been  presented  in  the 

previous  chapter.  This  chapter  is  designed  to  empirically  test  the  proposed 

framework on the data provided by a market research PBO.  

 

3.1. Methodological framework 

The  methodological  framework  is  a  technical  guideline  for  the 

theoretical  framework  of  the  study. In  this  section, first, the  overall logic 

of  data  analysis  and  sampling  is  described;  second,  I  outline  the  main 

hypothesis of the study and, third, I proceed with research objectives.  

The  application  of  lean  tools  within  project-based  cluster  of 

industries is yet poorly explored  in both literature and empirically, which 

highlights a methodological complexity associated with: 

1)  Adaptation  of 

the  philosophy  of  constant  processes  and 

operations to temporary and variable operations; 

2)  Control  and  Information  Systems.  If  we  regard  project 

management as a control system, then the temporary knowledge 

generated  within  a  project  has  to  be  captured  and  distributed  to 

inform  management decisions; this particular point constitutes a 

controversy with lean thinking, which emphasizes elimination of 

 

35 

 

 

unnecessary control and embedding it within the [stable] system 

(Ohno, 1988).  

The  aforementioned  parameters  drive  this  study  inevitably  towards 

process  and  activity  level,  which  goes  hand  in  hand  with  the  terms  of 

effectiveness  and  efficiency  as  well  as  overall  project  success  -  all  of 

which are the hallmarks of lean manufacturing principles (Upte and Goh, 

2004; Kaplan and Norton, 2004). Process level is also the key element of 

lean management regarded as a tool for optimization by first and foremost 

concentrating on elimination of waste, defined as any activity that does not 

add  value  to  the  end  product.  The  essence  of  value  in  this  study  is 

considered  from  the  viewpoint  of  internal  customers,  i.e.  project  team 

members  that  create  value  based  on  client  specifications.  Based  on  the 

Toyota  Production  System  principles,  this  study  seeks  to  resolve 

company’s  internal  contradictions  and  gaps  in  value  creation  process  by 

offering  an  applied  management  tool  of  measuring  project  performance. 

The emphasis on VSM, as well as key indicators suitable for performance 

measurement in service environment comes directly from the literature and 

serves as conceptual basis of the devised framework (Exhibit 4). 

The research design, following the devised framework (Exhibit 4) is 

multiphased.  The  first  stage  consists 

in  developing 

the  specific 

understanding  of  either  waste  for  the  chosen  company  by  means  of 

qualitative  methods,  specifically  –  interviewing  company  experts.  In  the 

current paper, I have chosen to study waste types due to inability to reach 

company clients and project stakeholders, which is the result of: 

1)  Dataset  collection  took  place  in  the  past  and  was  performed  by 

company management; 

2)  The  research  is  external  to  the  PBO,  which  deals  with  data 

sensitivity and confidentiality to open sources. 

 

36 

 

 

Accounting  for  the  service  industry  waste  types  found  in  scholarly 

literature (Bonaccorsi et al., 2011), an interview guide was developed (Part 

1,  Appendix  B)  in  order  to  assess  the  classic  waste  types  (Table  5, 

Appendix  A),  cross  out  the  unnecessary  ones  and  add  industry  and 

process–specific wastes.  

The second phase draws on the waste log, assembled during the first 

phase, to perform secondary data analysis of company’s dataset in order to 

define the proportion of wastes  across processes. Secondary data analysis 

represents  a  multidimensional  method,  which  implies  any  subsequent 

analysis  of 

the  dataset  providing 

interpretations,  conclusions  and 

investigations  additionally  or  apart  from  preliminary  study  report  in 

general  or  in  its  particular  aspects  (Hakim,  1982).  This  means  that  the 

company in question did not previously used or assembled the dataset for 

the purposes described in this study.  

During  the  third  step  the  repetitive  processes  across  and  within 

projects  are  analyzed  using  Overall  Equipment  Efficiency  (OEE)  for  the 

reasons  described  in  section  2.1.2.  This  method  represents  a  Total 

Productive  Maintainance 

tools  and  visually 

represents  process 

losses/wastes  independently  of  the  whole  system,  in  which  the  process  is 

integrated.  

 

37 

 

 

Exhibit 4. Framework of the study 

The  fourth  stage  is  performed  by  depicting  a  Value  Stream  Map, 

specifically  –  current  state  of  process  alignment  and  flow.  This  technique  is 

adopted  in  order  to  provide  inputs  for  root  cause  analysis  of  process 

inefficiencies, which form a platform for management decisions. 

 

 

3.1.1.  Research hypothesis 

The  main  hypothesis  of  the  paper  consists  in  proposition  that  a 

methodology assembled from lean tools and following lean principles can be 

used  to  measure  project  performance  in  service  PBO  (H1).  The  sub-

hypotheses of this proposition are: 

1)  Average  project  lead  time  can  be  reduced  by  at  least  10%  by 

means of waste elimination (H1.1); 

2)  Average  process  OEE  is  below  world-class  figures  (85%) 

(Arcidiacono et al., 2012) (H1.2); 

Testing  these  hypotheses  is  helpful  to  demonstrate  the  diagnostic 

power  of  the  devised  methodology  in  addition  to  ability  to  be  utilized  to 

measure project progress as development of EV methodology.  

 

38 

 

 

 

3.1.2.  Main goal and objectives 

The  main  goal  of  the  study  is  to  develop  current  methods  of  project 

control  and  project  performance  measurement 

in  order 

to 

inform 

management  decisions  on  project  structure,  resource  allocation  and 

optimization.  The  following  objectives  have  to  be  addressed  prior  to 

achievement of research goal: 

(1) In  theoretical  field:  synthesis  of  generic  waste  types  in  lean 

manufacturing  and  lean  service  to  provide  input  for  interview 

guides used to survey company experts. 

(2) In practical application: 

(a) Devise  a  semi-structured  interview  guide  and  screening 

questionnaire  to  assess  common  waste  types  and  assemble 

waste log; 

(b) Interview company experts; 

(c) Data  analysis  and  interpretation:  Secondary  data  analysis; 

visual  representation  of  process  OEE;  Depicting  Current 

State Map. 

In my viewpoint, these objectives will facilitate hypotheses validation 

and take the study directly to achievement of the main goal.  

 

 

39 

 

 

3.2.   Data analysis 

The process undertaken to acquire secondary as well as gather primary 

data is provided in section 3.1. The main findings of the study are presented 

in this section. During the first step, I outline the common characteristics of 

empirical  data  (3.2.1),  while  further  sections  pay  close  attention  to  the 

contents  and  interpretations  of  the  output  of  each  phase  (3.2.2-3.2.5), 

drawing  on  identified  specifications  and  frameworks,  used  as  theoretical 

basis of the devised framework.  

 

3.2.1. 

Sample and dataset characteristics 

The dataset is taken from longitudinal study carried out by one of the 

leading Project-Based Russian market research company in IPSOS group, in 

which  a  project  for  internal  monitoring  purposes  was  held  in  2012,  during 

which all employees filled in daily timesheets indicating:  

1)  Date; 

2)  Activities and processes to which the activities belong; 

3)  Time  estimate  for  the  specific  activities  by  project  manager 

(calculation of Total Available Time);  

4)  Actual time required to complete the task; 

5)  Project ID; 

6)  Project methodology; 

7)  Employee comments. 

The dataset itself was collected in Moscow, Russia. Sample size is 23 

500 observations, which represents about 700 projects within the time scope 

of one year and seven month. The main input for secondary data analysis as 

interpretative qualitative methodology is contained in the comment section, 

in which main issues, activity contents and characteristics are described, and 

which,  in  majority  of  project  cases,  remained  blank.  This  characteristic  of 

the  dataset  extremely  limited  the  number  of  projects,  suitable  for  analysis. 

 

40 

 

 

Total number of projects, reviewed via the secondary data analysis contains 

20  observations  (Exhibit  5).  All  projects  are  divided  into  several  types, 

ranging from ClickTest (Online questionnaire for testing how appealing the 

product  is)  to  PackTest  (Study  of  the  devised  alternatives  to  current  form-

factor  of  product  package).  Consequently,  the  selected  projects  differ  by 

size,  complexity  and  methodology  offered  to  the  client,  which  should  be 

valuable  in  terms  of  building  an  unbiased  and  holistic  perspective  of 

analysis.

During  the  first  stage,  which  required  gathering  primary  data,  I 

conducted  a  total  number  of  six  interviews  with  company  experts,  all  of 

which worked for various projects in the company and have been part of the 

committee, which initiated the project of internal monitoring.  

 

3.2.2.  Qualitative stage 

The first stage of qualitative stage is sampling. According to Marshall 

(1996:  522),  “an  appropriate  sample  size  for  a  qualitative  study  is  one  that 

adequately  answers  the  research  question”.  This  strategy  was  used  to  build 

theoretical sample, which, prompted by the main goal of the research, aims 

 

41 

 

 

to  advance  project  management,  i.e.  project  control.  This  is  why  all 

observations were gathered from project managers and coordinators, directly 

involved  in  the  process  of  project  control  across  projects  of  the  company. 

The validity of semi-structured interviews is considered to be high (Bariball 

and  While,  1994),  although,  as  any  qualitative  method,  it  does  not  provide 

the level of generalization, required of any quantitative technique. Therefore, 

the  results  of  the  study  are  confined  to  the  specific  company  data.  The 

validity of interview data in this study is based on: 

1) 

Personal  and  professional  acquaintance  with  interviewees, 

which  sets  mentally  comfortable  and  constructive  interview 

settings; 

2) 

Professional acquaintance  with  working  conditions, projects 

and  project  management  of 

the  company 

(previous 

employment); 

3) 

Interviewee  motivation  to  use  the  output  of  the  study  in 

enhancing  current  project  control  methodology  of  the 

company. 

All interviews were recorded and then transcribed for the purposes of 

data  analysis.  Research  ethics  was  closely  watched,  taking  interviewee’s 

consent for data processing, anonymity and confidentiality of data provided.  

The  interview  guide  contains  five  sections,  in  which  organizational 

context,  project  management,  project  and  process  efficiency  as  well  as 

organizational  learning  aspects  are  reflected  (Part  1,  Appendix  B).  A 

screening  questionnaire  was  also  prepared  as  supplementary  material  for 

interviews (Part 2, Appendix B).  

The  main  findings  of  each  section  were  organized  in  a  table,  which 

depicts a synthesis of waste types, experienced by interviewees (Table 2 and 

3,  Appendix  B).  To  summarize,  the  proportions  of  waste  categories  in 

accordance with Table 5 (Appendix A) are depicted in Exhibit 5. This chart 

 

42 

 

 

evidently  shows  that  the  structure  of  waste  in  the  company  is  highly 

fragmented, with Duplication/Rework, Waiting and Motion forming 54% of 

total structure. This suggests, first, that project resources are poorly utilized 

and  these  problems  deserve  close  consideration  by  itself,  and,  second,  that 

there is, in fact, cross-project set of wastes, that can be assembled, updated 

and  looked  at  when  filling  in  timesheets,  necessary  for  calculation  Earned 

Value.

wastes,  however  are  necessary  for  business  functioning),  which  in  total 

constitute  34%  of  total  number  of  waste  types.  The  proportion  of  business 

activities straight away is high; however, this only regards general mentions 

in  the  interview,  which  does  not  reflect  the  actual  proportion  in  project 

processes.

3.2.3. 

Secondary data analysis 

This  stage of  data  analysis  consisted  in  assigning  waste  type  codes 

to activities, which contained comments about activity content. In total, the 

deviation  between  actual  activity  descriptions  and  waste  definitions, 

presented in Table 3 (Appendix B), turned out to be low, which means that 

the majority of descriptions highlighted specific characteristics of defined 

waste types. In Exhibit 7, each waste type is shown according to the total 

number  of  project  hours  (Supplementary  materials  are  shown  in  Table  4, 

Appendix B).  

The  key  findings  from  Exhibit  7  consist  in  definition  of  four  most 

dangerous  waste 

types  for  company  projects  and  processes:  (1) 

Duplication/Rework, 

(2)  Unclear 

communication, 

(3)  Lack  of 

standardization  and  (4)  Lack  of  customer  focus.  Drawing  from  IHIP 

framework  (Table  4,  Appendix  A),  wastes  (1)  and  (4)  may  represent  the 

characteristics  of  perishability  and  intangibility  accordingly.  In  other 

words,  significant  amount  of  rework  is  connected  to  inability  to  store  a 

ready service or lack of customer focus as another reason, where the latter, 

in turn, can stem from promised performance and client  internal conflicts 

resulting  from  incomplete  understanding  at  project  initiation  phase  (high 

proportion of brief and proposal processes). Waste (2) is most often seen at 

 

44 

 

 

questionnaire stage, where organizational communication channel seem to 

be highly ineffective. Lack of standardization is most often at other project 

processes, which is  usually  pre-proposal stage, concerned  with  winning a 

client and giving paper documentation for prices, project details and other 

contractual information.

Another  significant  point  is  that  secondary  data  analysis  did  not 

allow  to  split  waste  types  from  business  activities,  which  happened 

because  short  comment  and  incomplete  sections  of  project  monitoring 

dataset.  Nevertheless,  in  terms  of  control  of  waste  occurrence  and 

underutilized  value  in  time  or  currency  equivalent  this  type  of  analysis 

turned out to be suitable.  

 

3.2.4.  Quantitative stage: OEE project overview 

The  devised  methodology  allows  depicting  efficiency  of  either  a 

process  or  a  project.  Since  I  search  for  an  aggregate  measure  of  project 

performance,  I  depicted  OEE  of  both  a  particular  project  (Exhibit  8)  and 

across projects (Exhibit 9). 

 

 

46 

 

 

Exhibit 9. Single project OEE 

 

To summon, Exhibit 8 depicts a project, in which all waste types are 

defined.  It  is  evident,  that  some  waste  types  occur  even  before  the  project 

has started, which is shown in the gap between “Total Available Time” and 

“Project  Time”.  Also,  the  transparency  of  project  efficiency  calculation  is 

seamless  in  representation  of  the  gap  between  “Project  Time”  and  “Value-

Added Time”.  

At the same time, the history of company’s project allows to develop 

understanding  of  possible  control  pitfalls  depending  on  the  size  of  the 

project. After  cross-project  calculation of OEE, I  noticed that projects  with 

average duration over 200 hours tend to be less effective than the small ones 

(Exhibit  9).  Each  project  is  represented  by  a  set  of  four  dots  on  a  vertical 

line, the example of which is shown on project number 20. Apparently, the 

rising  scale  of  project  turns  out  to  have  a  negative  effect  on  project 

efficiency  in  the  particular  case  of  this  company.  By  means  of  calculating 

average  OEE  across  projects,  a  figure  of  80%  can  be  directly  compared  to 

world  class  figures,  observed  by  Arcidiacono  (2012),  which  is  85%. 

Therefore,  hypotheses  H1.1  and  H1.2  are  verified  by  the  study.  Regarding 

 

47 

 

 

the  first  hypothesis,  project  OEE  ranges  from  61%  to  88%  which  denotes 

that  at  least  10%  of  project  lead  time  can  be  shortened  by  careful  waste 

elimination.

3.2.5.  Value Steam Map of company’s processes 

During  the  last  stage  of  data  analysis,  I  depicted  a  simplified  Value 

Stream Map (VSM) for the investigated market research PBO (Exhibit 10). 

Even  though  to  read  the  diagram,  the  list  of  abbreviations  (Exhibit  1, 

Appendix  B)  is  required,  the  understanding  of  the  key  insights  is  easy  to 

capture.  It  is  the  overview  of  interconnections  between  typical  project 

processes and highlights of the key project areas at which key wastes occur.  

Firstly, one of the lean-evident key defects of the system, for instance, 

is  push-based  transfer  from  one  process  to  the  next;  on  contrary,  scholarly 

literature  advocates  the  role  of  pull-based  transitions  for  service  sector 

(Ahlstrom,  2004).  Second,  project  management  department  seem  to  be 

overloaded  with  current  procedures  of  project  control,  since  there  are 

multiple  points  of  client  interaction  and  regulations;  much  of  project 

 

48 

 

 

manager’s  workload  comes  from  poorly  standardized  interaction  between 

project  team  and  support  department  and  suppliers.  This  stands  for  higher 

proportion  of  micromanagement  of  processes,  which  leaves  less  time  for 

process improvement, shortening of project lifecycle and, in effect, a number 

of projects processed in time period.  

 

 Exhibit 11. Value Stream Map for market research PBO

 

Nevertheless,  the  devised  approach  including  VSM  shows  positive 

results  in  terms  of  extending  the  role  of  project  control  and  performance 

measurement  by  bringing  in  visual  representation  of  processes  and  their 

efficiency.  From  researcher’s  viewpoint  it  is  difficult  to  depict  the 

characteristics of each process due to insufficient sample, sensitive data and 

lack  of  company-specific  insights  into  project  management.  Additionally, 

company’s projects range according to selected methodology, field, scale of 

representativeness and other market research parameters. The depicted map, 

though,  shows  a  generalized  view  on  the  flow  of  value  creation  process, 

 

49 

 

 

operating  with  average  OEE  for  available  projects  at  80%  level.  Thus,  I 

consider the main hypothesis of the study to be valid.  

3.3.  Discussion of the results 

 

The  analytical  materials,  presented  above,  follow  the  devised 

methodological  framework  of  the  study  (Section  3.1).  The  data  gathered 

from primary and secondary sources verified all the hypotheses, which were 

set  to  test  whether,  in  fact,  there  are  measurable  insights  into  project 

efficiency acquired from lean principles and tools. 

 Although  the  aforementioned  company-specific  set  of  wastes  has 

been  defined,  systematized  and  used  to  interpret  project  non-value-added 

time,  this  paper  does  not  build  direct  empirical  connection  of  the  proposed 

methodology  with  Earned  Value  data.  At  this  stage,  this  was  not 

accomplished  due  to  a  number  of  reasons,  including  competitor  sensitive 

schedule  and  budget  costs  of  analyzed  projects,  some  of  which  were  still 

ongoing.  The  unavailability  of  the  data  on  client  interaction  also  draws  the 

line under interpretation of waste and/or value, because primary “clients” of 

the  firm  played  secondary  role  in  the  study,  while  “the  voice  of  the 

customer”  was  considered  to  be  articulated  by  internal  customers,  namely 

project  managers  and  coordinators,  which  had  diverse  project  work 

experience. 

One of the specific problems of attributing waste or value indicators in 

project  activities  consisted  in  active  involvement  of  client  representatives 

during the whole value creation process. In practice, although the theoretical  

foundation denotes that customer experience as well as value definition from 

external  (primary)  client  is  in  priority  (Frei,  2006),  this  study  shows  that 

clients  do  change  their  mind  due  to  budget  restrictions,  scope  redefinition, 

schedule  adjustments  and  other  circumstances,  which  significantly  distorts 

project  scope  approved  during  initiation  phase.  While  the  contracting 

 

50 

 

 

company (PBO in question) continues to execute projects regardless of these 

changes,  they  actually  produce  more  rework  than  internal  communication 

and standardization problems of the company (see Exhibit 7). This may alter 

the way, in which value is defined in project-based settings (outside service 

companies with repetitive operations). 

Overall, the selected lean principles and tools turned out to be closely 

connected  to  project control  methodology  both  at  conceptual  and  empirical 

levels.  When  a  particular  project  is  analyzed  using  Earned  Value  and  a 

negative deviation is observed at specific time period, a defined set of wastes 

helps to classify all the activities occurring at specific date according to the 

standardized understanding of value (via Waste Log), gathered from internal 

clients  of  the  company.  With  this  tool  at  hand,  the  people  as  well  as  the 

reasons  for  deviations  can  be  scrutinized,  since  a  responsible  person  (for  a 

particular activity) fills in a timesheet required for EV. As a result, less time 

is needed to actually control project execution and more time can be devoted 

to managing deviations as they occur.  

At this point, the secondary aspects of lean (defined in section 2.1.1), 

namely  decentralization  and  vertical  information  systems  are  beginning  to 

make  more  sense  in  terms  of  their  actual  potential  of  reducing  waste.  For 

instance,  decentralization  may  act  like  a  waste  and  to  be  hidden  in  defined 

underutilized employees, which, combined with increased volume of unclear 

communication  waste  may  demonstrate  that  management  must  be  more 

centralized  and  coordinated.  At  the  moment  project  employees  seem  to 

strive  for  tackling  the  problems  themselves  under  supervision  of  project 

managers, however the resulting proportion of inefficiency calls for definite 

intervention from the management side.  

The  aspect  of  vertical  IS,  on  the  contrary,  is  conceptually  more 

suitable for the chosen PBO as a solution point for unclear communication, 

standardization,  updating  project  materials  and  waiting  waste  types.  The 

 

51 

 

 

output  of  interviews,  which  contained  questions  regarding  knowledge 

management  in  the  organization  revealed  a  lack  of  unity  in  knowledge 

codification, storage and distribution. The majority of projects were held in 

secure  folders  on  shared  intranet  repositories,  where  no  single  system  is 

utilized  to  make  the  knowledge  generated  within  projects  available  and 

learnable.  

 

 

 

 

52 

 

 

4.  Practical recommendations 

Essentially, lean principles and handbooks denote that each waste type 

has specific ways of resolving; however, the definition of the custom cluster 

(low  repetitiveness of  operations)  of  service  companies partially  prevents a 

definitive set of solutions to be established across companies. 

 At the same time, there is another integral parameter, which can serve 

as  an  indicator  for  applicability  of  potential  recommendations  within  the 

cluster: organizational maturity stage. Notably, according to OPM3, the last 

stage  of  maturity  is  continuous  improvement  held  at  the  level  of  managing 

portfolio  of  projects  (PMI,  2004),  which  sounds  incredibly  similar  to  the 

principle  of  kaizen,  formulated  and  utilized  by  Japanese  manufacturers 

decades  before  the  establishment  of  Project  Management  Institute  (PMI). 

Nevertheless,  following  this  approach  it  becomes  evident,  that  a  set  of 

recommendations can be highly applicable to PBO, which are at the level of 

measurement and standardization held at the level of projects and programs.  

The  recommendations  formulated  in  this  section  stem  directly  from 

the  results  of  the  empirical  study  held  in  the  chosen  market  research  PBO. 

As  noted  in  earlier  chapters,  the  first  milestone  on  the  way  to  continuous 

improvement is standardization of input forms (4.1). Secondly, in order for 

standardization to be used, a pull-based mechanism of project analytics has 

to  be  established  in  the  form  of  information  system  (IS),  which  would 

support  a  demand  for  project  analytics  in  further  organizational  structure, 

enabling  the  feedback  loop  to  project  managers;  I  refer  this  aspect  as 

knowledge-based control loop (4.2). 

 

4.1 Standardization 

 

The aspect of standardization plays the paramount role of reducing the 

risk of making a uniformed decision about project progress. As noted above, 

while EV methodology gives a numerical estimate for progress, however the 

53 

 

 

 

reasons behind any deviation have to be qualitatively investigated by project 

manager,  which,  in  essence,  is  micromanagement.  To  avoid  the  need  for 

micromanagement, a set of baseline causes for deviations must be somehow 

reflected and estimated in the form of, for instance, a timesheet, required of 

EV.  Using  the  approach,  developed  in  this  paper,  the  essentiality  of  waste 

identification in timesheets becomes more and more obvious.  

After  the  initial  monitoring  of  waste  types  of  the  company  has  been 

completed,  the  information  gathered  on  this  stage  serves  as  an  input  for 

defining,  estimating  and  eliminating  performance  losses.  However  if  the 

form of a timesheet is too complicated or requires too detailed information, 

no single employee of the firm is going to use it. That is why a template of 

information required for waste estimation is devised (Exhibit 12)

A  standardized  form,  in  which  only  basic  parameters  are  included, 

becomes  a  powerful  tool  for  decision-making.  Column  “Waste”  contains 

waste  type  (or  code),  which  serves  as  explanation  for  missing  deadlines  or 

budgeted  costs,  while  column  “Estimate”  contains  an  approximate  value  in 

percentage of the operation completed. This timesheet template, in addition 

to  information  about  milestone  achievement, can  as  well  serve  as  input  for 

EV.  Taking  into  consideration  the  resistance  to  complete  reports  daily,  a 

standardized  form  like  this  enables  to  put  less  strain  on  employees  by 

offering a single form to fill in the end of the day. 

Another  solution  for  initial  estimation  of  waste  can  be  transferred  to 

IS,  particularly  by  enabling  intra-program  analytics  about  duration  of 

 

54 

 

 

activities and offering to select reasons for overdue. This approach might be 

more sensible also because a system can be programmed to allow timesheet 

submission  only  in  case  deviations  are  explained  using  standard  waste  log. 

However,  conditions  of  timesheet  usage  can  differ  from  company  to 

company, and that is why both alternatives present an excellent opportunity 

to  gather  more  project  data.  The  use  of  the  data  gathered  at  this  stage  is 

presented in the next section. 

 

4.2. Knowledge-based project control loop (KPCL) 

As  stated  above,  project  control  mechanisms  are 

the  main 

determinants  of  project  performance  in  service  industries  (Upte  and  Goh, 

2004),  which  is  why  the  form  of  project  control  has  to  be  (a)  based  on 

feedback  from  project  managers  and  project  team  on  the  one  hand  and  (b) 

aligned  with  the  rest  of  firm’s  projects  (as  projects  might  compete  for 

resources)  on  the  other.  While  at  the  moment  project  control  in  the 

investigated  PBO  remained  indisputably  in  the  hands  of  project  managers, 

the alignment of projects in a program or portfolio cannot be held by simple 

awareness  of  other  managers’  projects.  This  is  why  a  control  system  to 

maintain both functions simultaneously is needed. The first step, however, is 

to establish a project management office (PMO) to actually use project data 

and inform alignment of projects, including process optimization.  

The  scheme  of  proposed  project  control  loop  for  assembling, 

analyzing and distributing knowledge about project bottlenecks is presented 

in Exhibit 13. The picture takes on view from three perspectives – employee 

intranet  access,  IS  and  PMO,  because  these  are  the  main  three  forces  of 

knowledge creation and distribution: project team is the source of data, IS is 

used to both clarify, pre-analyze and distribute ready-to-use solutions, while 

PMO  acts  like  “knowledge  broker”,  which  makes  a  research,  analyses  and 

 

55 

 

 

makes  decisions  on  whether  a  process  (practice)  can  be  optimized  to 

increase project efficiency.  

It  is  important  to  note,  that  Exhibit  13  shows  both  instant  and  long-

term  processes  of  knowledge  usage  to  transform  the  way  in  which  an 

organization  operates.  For  instance,  timesheet  submission  might  be  a  daily 

or weekly procedure, while drawing current state map and future state map, 

as well as establishing which practice should be a standard, usually takes up 

the  input  of  a  number  of  projects,  i.e.  significant  amount  of  time.  The 

difference  of  time  horizons,  at  the  same  time,  should  not  be  an  excuse  to 

discard the search for continuous improvement, which Exhibit 13 ultimately 

represents.  Both  theoretically  and  in  practice,  the  knowledge  accumulated 

and  distributed  among  team,  which  takes  on  a  typical  project,  helps  to 

immensely reduce the activity of reinventing the wheel, i.e. waste time. The 

leading  role  of  PMO  can  be  drawn  from  the  prognostic  function  (duration 

analysis  using  EV)  and  optimization  (removing  reasons  behind  waste 

activities),  which  is  why  establishment  of  PMO  is  highly  desirable  for  the 

analyzed company.  

At  the  moment,  highly  dispersed  knowledge  exists  in  the  minds  of 

project  managers  and  teams,  which  remain  rather  stable  across  one  or 

several  industries.  The  unnoticed  similarity  of  both  waste  and  value  across 

industries  and  firm’s  projects  presents  a  potential  for  boosting  firm’s 

performance  by  first  and  foremost  reducing  project  lead  times,  which,  as 

shown in the study, can be achieved by defining and eliminating waste.

5. Conclusion 

The current dissertation provides a number of insights into the field of 

project  management,  lean  management  and  combination  of  the  two  with 

respect  to  project  control  and  project  performance  measurement.  First,  the 

development  of  lean  thinking  has  spread  from  manufacturing  and  service 

repetitive  operations  to  project-based  work,  which  builds  a  bridge  for 

retranslation of lean principles in project control tools, which would structure 

project planning  and execution,  placing value  (in both  economic  and project 

control  meaning)  front  and  center.  The  second  insight  builds  on  specific 

aspects  of  service  industry  and  the  need  to  follow  the  path  of  concept  and 

practice  localization.  While  the  tools  I  used  to  demonstrate  applicability  did 

not undergo significant modifications, some characteristics of a service helped 

to  shape  the  understanding  of  root  causes  of  certain  wastes.  Thirdly,  the 

understanding  of  the  significance  of  project  diagnostics,  which  form  a 

transparent  structure  of  value  creation,  provides  a  practice,  which  can  be 

utilized in the management of project-driven organizations.  

Due to unsurprisingly low availability of data, required to construct a 

precondition  for  lean  project  management,  the  necessary  conceptual  links 

between  project  and  lean  management  exist  in  both  literature  and  practical 

application.  The  justification  of  this  thesis  has  led  the  study  towards  a 

conclusion,  according  to  which  project  management  has  to  take  control  of 

value  creation  chain.  Although  at  the  moment  the  requirements  for 

transparency of value creation are confined to timesheets filling and Earned 

Value  methodology  in  one  case,  or  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPI)  or 

Critical  Success  Factors  (CSF)  in  other,  the  actual  understanding  of  value 

differs across the three. The breakthrough idea of the dissertation is that the 

different understandings of value do not necessarily have to be converted in 

a  single  analytical  unit;  on  the  contrary,  one  method  can  cope  with  the 

drawbacks of the other.  

 

58 

 

 

One  of  the  main  findings  related  to  the  overload  of  project 

management department builds a link with the need for a more centralized, 

aggregate  and  knowledge-based  means  of  communication,  storage  and 

distribution of project information. One of the outtakes related to vertical IS 

actually  deals  with  this  need,  however  in  a  too  generalized  way.  More 

specifically,  the  main  solution  to  corporate  problems  and  leveraging  the 

already  existing  knowledge 

in  the  company  consists 

in  aggressive 

knowledge management methods, which constitute a good practice in more 

advanced  and  knowledge-literate  companies.  The  pool  of  such  systems  is 

often called Project Management Information Systems (PMIS). Although the 

positive  links  of  these  systems  with  increased  user  productivity  as  well  as 

project success have already been discovered (Raymond & Bergeron, 2008), 

the  current  case study  revealed the  absence  of  such  mechanism  for, first of 

all,  formulating  the  arguments  for  management  decisions.  The  important 

prerequisite  of  data-based  decision-making  is  simply  disregarded;  the 

knowledge generated within projects remains buried in the minds of project 

managers  and  abandons  the  flow  of  valuable  information  across  the 

company.  As  noted  before,  this  facilitates  the  need  for  more  trainings, 

coaching  and  other  knowledge  sharing  procedures,  which,  at  the  current 

company’s  lifecycle  stage,  remain  unstandardized  and/or  outdated,  pulling 

valuable human resources for project control. 

The  directions  for  further  research  stem  from  the  main  conceptual 

edges of  the  current study. For  instance, the  understanding  of value, which 

differs  from  one  methodology  to  another,  is  still  uncertain  regarding  lean 

principles  as  applied  in  project-based  companies.  The  availability  of  the 

necessary data, as well as client interaction, in my viewpoint, could form a 

framework of measuring value from actual understanding of what value is at 

particular  project  stages.  This  notion  would  also  improve  the  methodology 

devised in this study: the understanding of value refines the understanding of 

 

59 

 

 

waste.  Another  significant  direction  is  to  more  specifically  define  the 

algorithms  of  knowledge  accumulation  and  sharing,  project  learning.  This 

may  refer  to  either  building  a  Future  State  Map,  or  developing  the  internal 

principles or  standards of project work or devising templates for more lean 

friendly  data  access  points,  which  would  reflect  company’s  regulations  on 

knowledge  management  procedures.  Overall, a  study, which  would  test  the 

applicability of the devised EV extension on quantitative industry-wide data, 

is  highly  desirable  due  to  its  fresh  and  independent  view  on  the  current 

project management practice.

6. Critical reflections 

This study is notable for me in two respects. First, this is a conscious 

attempt  to  develop  a  methodology,  which  is  commonly  used  and  widely 

known.  This  sets  a  particular  challenge  in  terms  of  conceptual  linkage, 

easiness  of  practical  application  and  critical  reflections  of  the  main 

stakeholders,  involved  in  this  processes.  Second,  although  this  is  a  desk-

based research, a defined and detailed project plan prevented or alleviated a 

number  of  risks,  connected  to  stakeholder  environment  of  the  project, 

schedule deviations and project control mechanisms. For instance, when risk 

mitigation  was  developed  for  an  unfavorable  outcome  of  negotiations  with 

initially selected market research PBO management, I already developed the 

possible options of resolving the problem of unavailable data. In this regard, 

I  mastered  the  combination  of  both  development  and  support  of  project 

documentation, required of a good project management practice.   

This  study  has  also  formed  a  springboard  for  a  future  career  of 

optimization  of  project  management  procedures  in  Russian  and  European 

counties,  which  lack  the  systematic  and  value  driven  approach  for 

performance  measurement  and  project  control.  The  critical  incident  of 

articulation,  search,  justification  and  application  of  a  never  defined  or 

conceptually  established  method  increased  my  personal  awareness  of  tools 

and  methodologies,  which  can  form  a  basis  for  actual  performance 

improvement, versus purely theoretical claims. My dissertation establishes a 

means  to  insightfully  manage  schedule  deviations,  providing  crucial 

understanding of the hidden causes.

Description 

(1) Understanding 

customer value 

(2) Value stream 

analysis 

(3) Flow 

(4) Pull 

(5) Perfection 

This means that only the requirements of customers, either internal 
or  external  are  important.  In  project  management  literature  the 
“customers” are the main stakeholders of the project, who always 
define the value of each product in their own terms. The role of a 
project manager at this point is to synthesize the concept of value, 
which is maximal to satisfy each stakeholder’s need; 
This principle facilitates the need to walk all the way through value 
creation processes: process-by-process and even further – down to 
activity  level.  If  the  process  is  regarded  as  value-added,  there  is 
still  a  need  to  analyze  activities  and  see  whether  all  of  them  are 
indispensable  for  the  next  project  stakeholder.  The  non-valued-
added  activities  and  processes  have  to  be  eliminated  from  the 
structure of business unit functioning; 
Having  taken  a  snapshot  of  the  current  state  and  eliminated  the 
unnecessary  elements,  it  is  important  to  take  a  step  further  and 
cater  for  the  coherency  and  seamless  connections  between 
processes  and  activities,  so  that  the  continuous  flow  of  value 
creation  processes  proliferates  from  supply  chain  through  the 
production  and  further  to  product  distribution.  In  classic  project 
management  a  risk  plan  plays  a  role  of  identification  of  potential 
wastes and gaps between activities or processes; 
Pull  as  transfer  to  low-buffer  system  of  activity-based  scheduling, 
which  similarly  to  theory  of  constrains  (TOC),  introduced  by 
Goldratt (2003), is based on the staged release of system bottlenecks 
and  extension  of  this  approach  throughout  the  value  chain.    In 
essence, an activity should only be performed at pace, at which the 
output  of  this  activity  is  required  downstream  (Andersson  et  al., 
2006), which prevents stock and waiting time for the whole chain; 

This  principle  reflects  the  philosophical  aspect  of  lean,  called 
“kaizen”,  continuous  improvement,  which  outlines  the  importance 
of constant efforts aimed at reducing waste. In project management, 
this refers more to knowledge base maintenance and constant pull of 
knowledge,  generated  by  ongoing  projects,  and  further  distribution 
to  future  project  entities,  which  would  reduce  waste  of  reinventing 
the wheel.

Tool 

Description 

 

VSM  is  a  lean  tool  that  identifies  the  flows  of  information  and 
materials,  thereby  helping  practitioners  to  concentrate  on  the  principle  of 
flow  instead  of  particular  wastes  in  the  system  (Yu  et  al.,  2009).  After  the 
idea  of  value-added  and  non-value-added  activities  is  obtained  (Hines  & 
Rich,  1997),  the  first  step  is  to  depict  a  current  state  map  (CSM),  which 
describes  the  processes  as  they  now  occur  (Tapping  et.  Al.,  2002).  In 
production line shop floor, it is invaluable to use stopwatch to record actual 
times  for  each  process  to  obtain  reliable  data  (Rother  and  Shook,  2003), 
however in  either classic project  management settings (i.e. construction) or 
service  industries  management  where  projects  are  highly  customized, 
walking the whole way through the value stream is hardly possible. Instead, 
in likewise cases Yu et al. (2009) suggests to use an intranet tracking system 
distribute  the  role  of  data  collection  among  project  executers,  in  which  the 
data  inputs  are  quite  similar  to  earned  value  methodology:  “the  booking 
date,  confirmed  start  date,  actual  start  date,  and  actual  finish  date  of  every 
task”  (Yu  et  al.,  2009:  783).  After  the  CSM  is  analyzed  and  wastes  are 
eliminated,  a  future  state  map  (FSM)  has  to  demonstrate  the  improved 
structure of processes with corresponding timing (Tapping et al., 2002).

Another tool, which is very close to standardized work, is error proofing. It 
refers to the introduction of visual control mechanisms, which embed safety 
and functionality (Shingo & Dillon, 1986) (in manufacturing settings), for 
instance, by changing the form of a socket, which physically does not engage 
if applied upside down 

Using  description  provided  by  Kilpatrick  (2003),  Total  Productive 
Maintenance  (TPM)  utilizes  methods  of  equipment  maintenance  and  “calls 
upon  the  knowledge  and  cooperation  of  operators,  equipment  vendors, 
engineering,  and  support  personnel 
to  optimize  plant  performance” 
(Damrath, 2012: 19). The main goal of this tool is to increase the lifecycle of 
equipment usage, therefore decreasing downtime, breakages, stops, etc. The 
OEE  is  an  approach  adopted  from  lean  management  and  it  represents  a 
powerful  method  to  monitor  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  manufacturing 
and  transactional  processes,  and  is  frequently  used  as  key  metric  in  Total 
Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Lean programs. One of the main goals 
is  to  reduce  the  “Six  big  losses”,  clustered  in  three  categories:  Downtime, 
Speed and Quality losses (Arcidiacono et al, 2012). This is a significant tool 
for  project  management,  as  the  metrics  for  equipment  can  be  emulated  for 
human operators, as the numerical estimation for task completion is mainly 
given  in  time  equivalent.  In  manufacturing  environment  the  calculation  of 
OEE  has  already  become  both  standard  and  additional  business  solution, 
offered  by  giants  of  assembly  lines  such  as  Siemens  (2014),  which  has 
devised  automatic  calculation  software.  The  logic  of  OEE  calculation  is 
presented in Exhibit 3 (Appendix). 

Manufacturing  settings,  however  have  a  range  of  other  highly 
applied tools, one of which is  Single Minute Exchange of  Dimes (SMED), 
which stands for reduction of setup time (below 10 minutes), when multiple 
types of units are manufactured using the same equipment, which allows to 
achieve lower unit costs and decrease the amount of stock (McIntosh et al., 
2000). Another tool closely related to maintenance is 5S, which represents a 
guideline  of  visual  control  of  workplace  and  operations  optimization  (i.e. 
sorted  tools,  standard  movements,  etc.).  There  is  also  a  Failure  Mode  and 
Effects  Analysis  (FMEA),  which  is  used  to  “prioritize  potential  defects 
based  on  their  severity,  expected  frequency,  and  probability  of  detection” 
(Damrath,  2012:  20).  These  and  other  tools  are  highly  applicable  to  highly 
repetitive and standardized production process, however their adjustment to 
project  management  is  highly  challenging  due  to  the  aforementioned  non-
repetitive essence of activities in most projects.

Description 

This  type  of  services  stands  for  a 
restructuring  of  a  system,  for  instance  in 
education,  government,  public  safety,  etc.  The 
repeatability  of  such  projects  is  low  due  to  the 
volume and scale of work to be done. Customer 
involvement  is  usually  high  in  the  planning 
phase,  where  customer  requirements  have  to 
define  the  new  system;  however,  the  next 
contact occurs only when the project is finished 
and the service is handed to the client. . 

 
Custom type of services is characterized 
by significant role of facilities: resources, tools, 
datasets,  etc.  of  service  provider,  which  are 
utilized  to  solve  customer’s  problem.  Although 
the solution to the problem is easy to articulate, 
the  way  to  actually  solve  the  problem  is  not. 
This  is  why  higher  customer  interaction  is 
needed  to  define  and  redefine  the  provider’s 
approach  to  problem  solving.  Some  classic 
examples  of  this  category  are  management 
consulting,  legal  services,  market  research  and 
analytics,  branding,  advertising,  IT  platform 
development,  etc.  The  majority  of  such 
companies  are  project-based  organizations 
(PBO).  

highly 

 
This  category  is  characterized  by  high 
similarity  with  manufacturing  process,  as  it 
requires 
standardized 
operations  to  be  optimized,  while  customer 
inputs 
into 
standard groups. Examples of this category may 
include  fast  food,  banking,  insurance,  call 
centers, retail, etc.

classified 

this 

category 

Interactive  type  is  based  on  the  history 
of  interaction  between  customers  and  service 
providers.  Generally, 
is 
characterized  by  high  competition  among 
companies  and  customer  experience 
is  as 
important  as  the  service  itself.  Even  though 
initial  set  of  customer  requests  is  defined  and 
optimized,  there  are  numerous  factors  that 
contribute 
to  more  personal  and  deviant 
requests,  which  are  also  considered  to  be 
important  part  of  service  provision.  Some 
examples  include  airline  companies,  hotels, 
healthcare and restaurants.

Promised performance (Moeller, 2010); 
Refers to increased presence of human factor in service 
quality, which differs from one operator to another. It also 
highlights that service standardization is only possible to 
some extent (Damrath, 2012) 
Services are consumed as they are being produced, 
simultaneously 
Inability to store a ready service 

- Customers are the central part of orientation in 

many service industries;  

- The customer evaluates both the output of 

value creation process and the experience (Johnston and 
Clark, 2001). This point is extremely relevant for many 
service PBO, be because customer interaction and 
negotiations, which may distort the working order and 
be seen as waste, may actually add value to their 
experience. 

- The classic waste type, inventory, is not a 

problem for service sector, since a pure service cannot 
be physically stored. This highlights that in service 
value stream each activity always has to be pulled.
