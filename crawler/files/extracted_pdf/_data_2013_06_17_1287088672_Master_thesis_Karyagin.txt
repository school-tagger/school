Аннотация 

Магистерская  диссертация  на  тему  «Оценка  качества  кредитных  рейтингов 

облигаций» посвящена исследованию  вопроса насколько верно и адекватно кредитные 

рейтинги,  присвоенные  ведущими  рейтинговыми  агентствами  облигациям,  отражают 

кредитные  риски  инструментов.  Также  автор  был  заинтересован  провести  анализ 

информации,  содержащейся  в  рейтингах,  об  основных  индикаторах  которые 

рейтинговые  агентства  включают  в  свои  отчеты  о  точности  произведенных  оценок, 

таких как вероятность дефолта инструмента и процент возврата при дефолте (или, что 

эквивалентно, потерь в случае дефолта) и возможности использования альтернативных 

индикаторов  качества.  Рейтинги  в  мировой 

экономике  являются  важными 

индикаторами как для регуляторов, так и для индивидуальных инвесторов. Несмотря на 

более чем 100 летнюю историю с момента присвоения первого рейтинга и постоянное 

развитие  методологий  вопрос  об  адекватности  оценки  инструментов  со  стороны 

рейтинговых агентств остается актуальным в свете мирового финансового кризиса 2008 

года,  в  ходе  которого  многие  инструменты  с  высоким  рейтингом  испытывали 

трудности, что является результатом неточности оценки. 

 

В  магистерской  диссертации  были  исследованы  и  получены  ответы  на 

следующие вопросы: 

1.  Какую  информацию  несут  в  себе  рейтинги  облигаций  и  насколько  надежна 

данная информация для участников финансовых рынков? 

2.  Обладают ли рейтинги информацией о показателях, отличных от рассмотренных 

в  первом  вопросе  и  возможно  ли  ее  использовать  инвесторам  для  более 

детального  анализа  при  принятии  инвестиционных  решений?  Возможно  ли 

использовать  эту  информацию  чтобы  идентифицировать  облигации,  рейтинг 

которых завышен или занижен? 

3.  Какие  характеристики  облигаций  оказывают  существенное  влияние  на  потери 

при дефолте, вероятность присвоения неправильного рейтинга и каков характер 

этой взаимосвязи? 

 

Для  ответа  на  эти  вопросы  была  использована  коммерческая  база  данных 

рейтингового  агентства  Moody’s,  содержащая  детальную  информацию  обо  всех 

инструментах,  которым  агентство  присваивало  рейтинги,  а  также  о  дефолтах  и 

эмитентах.  Методика  исследований  вопросов  1  и  2  предполагала  построение  кривых 

Лоренца независимо для облигаций эмитентов финансового и нефинансового секторов 

экономики  и  расчет  коэффициентов  Джини  для  определения  степени  информации, 

содержащейся  в  рейтингах  для  каждого  конкретного  случая.  В  результате  автор 

получил следующие выводы: 

-  Рейтинги  корректно  отражают  информацию  о  вероятности  дефолта  для  обоих 

рассматриваемых  секторов  экономики.  Тем  не  менее,  объяснительная  сила 

рейтингов  для  вероятности  дефолта  у  финансовых  облигаций  существенно 

меньше,  чем  у  нефинансовых,  и одинакова  для  всех  рассмотренных  временных 

интервалов.  Что  касается  нефинансовых  облигаций,  то  рейтинги  существенно 

лучше  отражают  вероятность  дефолта  на  временном  промежутке  до  1  года. 

Автор  полагает,  что  для  корректной  оценки  вероятности  дефолта  финансовых 

организаций  требуется  использовать  дополнительные  к  рейтингам  источники 

информации. 

-  Рейтинги  слабо  коррелированы  с  потерями  в  случае  дефолта.  Они  практически 

не объясняют вариацию для облигаций финансового сектора и слабо объясняют 

для  нефинансового.  Тем  не  менее,  для  облигаций  нефинансового  сектора 

наблюдается резкое увеличение корреляции рейтингов и потерь в случае дефолта 

на  временном  промежутке  меньше  1  года.  Это  дает  основание  считать,  что  в 

данном  случае  рейтинги  можно  использовать  как  одну  из  переменных  для 

объяснения потерь на малых временных интервалах. 

- 

 Автор  протестировал  альтернативную  меру  качества  кредитных  рейтингов  – 

«реализованный  убыток».  Данная  мера  в  силу  определения  учитывает  как 

вероятность  дефолта,  так  и  потери  в  случае  дефолта  и  определена  для  всех 

облигаций, а не только тех, по которым произошел дефолт (в отличие от потерь в 

случае  дефолта).  Оказалось,  что  рейтинги 

содержат  информацию  о 

«реализованном 

убытке». 

Более 

того, 

данная 

мера 

превосходит 

вышеприведенные два индикатора, и так как Moody’s упоминает в методологии, 

что  при  присвоении  рейтингов  учитываются  оба  индикатора,  это  приводит  к 

выводу, что новая мера является более подходящей оценкой качества рейтингов. 

Кроме  этого,  автор  показал  возможность  использования  данной  меры  для 

выявления  облигаций  с  завышенным  и  заниженным  рейтингами,  что  делает  ее 

применимой для использования инвесторами. 

 

Ответ  на  третий  поставленный  вопрос  показал,  что  между  характеристиками 

облигаций  и  потерями  при  дефолте,  а  также  вероятностью  присвоения  неправильного 

рейтинга существует взаимосвязь. Значительные эффекты наблюдаются для следующих 

величин: 

-  время до погашения, коэффициент положителен, что свидетельство того, что для 

облигаций с большим временем до погашения характерны большие потери и им 

чаще присваиваются неверные рейтинги 

-  наличие  обеспечения  уменьшает  потери,  а  также  такие  облигации  реже  имеют 

неверные рейтинги 

-  принадлежность  к  определенной  индустрии  среди  облигаций  нефинансового 

сектора  оказывает  значительный  эффект  на  рассматриваемую  взаимосвязь. 

Облигации индустрий, продукты которых пользуются спросом даже в рецессиях 

имеют  меньшие  потери,  что  объясняется 

способностью  восстановить 

деятельность в условиях непрекращающегося спроса 

-  остальные  характеристики  не  продемонстрировали  значительных  эффектов,  что 

может быть вызвано малым количеством облигаций с такими характеристиками 

в выборке 

Вопросы и направления для дальнейших исследований: 

1.  Как могут рейтинговые агентства скорректировать свою методологию для учета 

показателя «реализованных убытков» и будет ли более подходящим публиковать 

в отчетах данный показатель вместо текущих двух? 

2.  Такие  характеристики  как  тип  облигации,  приоритетность  долга  и  валюта 

выпуска  показали  значимые  эффекты  в  некоторых  случаях,  но  как  было 

объяснено,  это  ложная  взаимосвязь  в  виду  малого  количества  облигаций  с 

такими  характеристиками  в  выборке.  Исследование  на  большей  выборке 

представляет дальнейший интерес. 

3.  Значение  R2  у  регрессий  довольно  низкое,  тем  не  менее,  они  значимы  в  силу 

высокого  значения  F-статистики.  Это  может  быть  следствием  того,  что 

оставшаяся вариация в зависимой переменной объясняется внешними данными, 

такими 

как 

показатели 

финансовой 

отчетности 

эмитента 

и 

макроэкономическими переменными. Данная гипотеза представляет интерес для 

дальнейших исследований.

Introduction 

Influence of credit ratings on the world economy became extremely significant in the last 

30 years. The contemporary credit rating market started forming in 1970s when the US Security 

and  Exchange  Commission  accepted  a  number  of  resolutions  for  brokers,  issuers,  banks  and 

number of other financial market participants. 

Nowadays  ratings  are  very  important  economic  and  political  factor  because  they 

essentially determine the cost of funding for issuing companies. Before the financial crisis 2008 

ratings were unquestionable indicators of issuer creditworthiness. Nevertheless, after significant 

defaults  number  of  highly  rated  companies  it  became  clear  that  at  least  in  the  past  rating 

methodology had not taken into account all possible risks properly. 

There  is  always  asymmetry  in  information  which  makes  exceptionally  difficult  for 

investor  to  estimate  all  possible  risks  inherent  in  particular  instrument.  This  happens  because 

rating process takes into account many factors and requires strong expertise for it. Thus, quality 

assessment  procedure  of  the  issue  becomes  almost  unrealistic  to  be  conducted  by  individual 

investor  without  external  assistance.  Exactly  for  that  purpose  auditors,  rating  agencies  and 

number  of  other  companies  are  operating.  Their  work  is  dedicated  to  decrease  asymmetry  in 

information  and  help  to  reduce  costs  that  individual  investor  would  bear  if  conducted  this 

original research. 

In light of discussed above it is quite hard to imagine the present-day world without credit 

rating,  which  underlines  extremely  importance  for  them  to  be  properly  assigned.  In  this  paper 

author’s  intention  was  to  investigate  the  last  problem  and  to  find  answers  on  the  following 

questions: 

1.  What  kind  of  information  is  present  in  assigned  ratings  and  how  reliable  is  this 

information for the participant of financial market? 

2.  Do ratings contain any additional information that can be used by investors for more 

detailed analysis of their financial decisions? Is it possible to use this information to 

find inconsistently rated bonds? 

3.  Which  of  the  bond  specific  variables  are  responsible  for  inconsistent  ratings  and  in 

which direction do they affect the bond losses? 

In order to answer these questions author studied existing scientific literature and publicly 

available  rating  agencies  methodologies.  Sample  used  in  this  research  was  constructed  using 

Moody’s  Default  Risk  Service  proprietary  database  which  contains  detailed  information  about 

each debt’s characteristics rated by Moody’s as well as brief summary for the default event and 

issuer details. For answer on the first question author studied the presence of information about 

 

6 

default  frequency  and  loss  given  default  in  assigned  ratings  because  Moody’s  methodology 

explicitly states that ratings reflect these both indicators. Approach used to answer this question 

involved  Lorenz  curves  and  calculation  of  accuracy  coefficients  as  rating  agencies  often  do. 

Based on the obtained results author claims that ratings do reflect correctly probability of default. 

Nevertheless, they are poor predictors of loss given default and may be used for the last purpose 

only  in  the  1  year  period  after  rating  assignment  as  additional  source  of  information  for 

prediction.  

For the second question author tested newly  introduced  measure  called realized  lifetime 

loss on the described above dataset. The idea for this indicator was mentioned in working paper 

by  Hainsworth  (2012)  but  was  not  assessed  by  the  author  on  the  real  data.  Methodology  was 

essentially  the  same  as  for  the  first  question  and  resulted  in  conclusion  that  information  about 

realized  lifetime  loss  is  contained  in  ratings  and  moreover,  ratings  reflect  it  better  that  default 

probability. Because this measure implicitly accounts for both default frequency and loss given 

default by construction it can be used as alternative indicator by rating agencies for accuracy of 

their predictions.  

Finally,  using  this  new  measure  author  counted  inconsistently  rated  issues  and  used 

indicator of misclassification in regression analysis to determine which variables are responsible 

for inconsistent rating. It turned out that there are few bond specific variables that are significant 

and can explain such ratings. Results obtained are significant but do not explain all variation in 

realized losses. Although author’s goal was not to build the model which explains total variation 

observed it would be interesting in further studies to utilize firm-specific variables and additional 

set of macroeconomic indicators which may account for the unexplained variation in losses. 

The rest part of the master thesis is constructed as follows: 

-  Chapter 1 discusses the existing topic-related literature 

-  Chapter  2  is  dedicated  to  study  the  relationship  between  rating  classes,  probability  of 

default and loss given default 

-  Chapter  3  introduces  realized  lifetime  loss  and  investigates  its  relationship  with  rating 

classes. These results are used to count inconsistently rated bonds and to find out which 

bond specific variables explain this phenomenon using regression models. 

-  Master thesis is completed with conclusion and tables in Appendix 1-4 which give more 

insights about sample used and other data.

Chapter 1. Literature review 

1.  Studies  investigating  presence  of  information  about  default 

frequency and loss given default in assigned ratings 

There are number of studies on credit ratings quality and the relationship between default 

frequencies  (which  is  good  proxy  for  default  probability)  as  well  as  recovery  rates  in  case  of 

default  but  they  do  not  constitute  a  substantial  amount  in  scientific  literature.  One  possible 

explanation  is  that  rating  agencies  are  publishing  their  own  very  detailed  papers  and  special 

comments  and  are  able  to  do  this  on  broad  data  sample.  It  is  quite  reasonable  to  think  that 

properly  assigned  ratings  should  reflect  information  about  both  probability  of  default  and  loss 

given default. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate empirical results that were obtained in 

the literature and highlight the most important points about rating agencies methodology. 

1.1.  Examination  of  information  about  default  frequency  contained  in 

assigned ratings 

One  of  the  earliest  found  papers  is  Altman  (1989).  This  study  gives  an  idea  that  for 

bondholders important information would be not only default probability but also volume lost in 

case  of  default.  Here  it  should  be  noted  that  it  is  basically  the  idea  for  loss  given  default  (or 

equally  the  recovery  rate;  this  concept  was  actually  introduced  by  three  major  rating  agencies 

after recent financial crisis). Altman introduced the concept  named  mortality rate and defined it 

for each rating class for a given year as 

 

The result is that author found significant correlation between rating classes and this indicator of 

defaults, specifically as it was expected the lowest mortality rates were obtained for the highest 

rated (“AAA”) bonds which are increasing dramatically when moving into non-investment grade 

issue classes. 

Although at the time this article was published rating agencies have not used the notion of 

recovery  rates,  Altman  did  the  research  on  relationship  between  the  percentage  of  par  that 

investor could get by selling defaulted bond and rating classes. He found that actually there is no 

correlation  between  first assigned rating and recovery  in case of default. Moreover, there  is  no 

relationship for investment-grade and junk bond as well as time to default also has no impact on 

recovery.

In  Godlewski  (2007)  paper  author  assessed  quality  of  ratings  assigned  to  banks  from 

emerging economies. Sample consisted of 483 banks  from  developing  markets in  Europe, Asia 

and  South  America.  On  this  data  author  run  a  logistic  model  for  defaults  prediction.  Then 

according  to  these  probabilities  empirical  distribution  was  reconstructed  and  used  to  predict 

ratings. Finally, these ratings were  used as inputs for scoring model as well as Moody’s ratings 

to  find  appropriate  scale  for  replicated  possibilities.  As  the  result,  for  the  given  model  author 

Godlewski  came  to  the  conclusion  that  Moody’s  ratings  are  on  average  in  line  with  default 

frequencies presented in the data. 

Another  important  question  that  was  raised  in  Bruche  and  Gonzalez-Aguado  (2010)  is 

about  relationship  between  default  probabilities  and  state  of  economy.  In  addition  to  that 

question  authors  also  studied  the  correlation  between  recoveries  and  credit  cycle  as  well  as 

default  frequency.  Bruche and Gonzalez-Aguado claimed that  in recessions default  frequencies 

should grow significantly and have to be followed by substantial drop in realized recoveries. In 

the sample of about 2000 US issues experienced default event in period 1974 – 2005 they found 

that  stated  above  hypothesis  is  correct.  In  order  to  model  state  of  economy  they  introduced  a 

two-parameter Markov chain. Main feature of the model is that it is  completely defined by two 

probabilities that are connected with  credit cycle: one for downturn state (which  is actually the 

probability of switching into normal state) and the other for probability of  going into recession, 

i.e. alteration from the normal state. This new additional variable indicating the state of economy 

was  also  compared  to  the  set  of  macroeconomic  variables.  The  results  show  that  correlation 

between  recoveries  and  probability  of  default  is  much  higher  that  correlation  between  each  of 

this  two  variables  and  macroeconomics  indicators.  This  is  explicit  evidence  shows  that  for 

explanation of recovery  it  is  more reasonable to use default  frequency as  the  basic  explanatory 

variable  (and  vice  versa)  and  macroeconomic  ones  should  be  used  to  account  for  the  rest  of 

unexplained variation in recovery rates. 

The  working  paper  by  Hilscher  and  Wilson  (2013)  is  the  most  recent  one.  The  main 

message of the paper is that for risk-averse bondholder credit ratings given that they are proper 

measure  of  issuer  quality  should  contain  both  information  about  probability  of  default  and 

market risk. The first question was assessed by modeling defaults with logistic regression using 

as  explanatory  variables  available  bookkeeping  data  and  market-based  information.  Model 

output was compared with actual default frequency. Prediction horizon was selected to be in the 

range from one month to five years. For the shortest time period authors found that ratings do not 

contain significant amount of supplementary  information compared to the used model. As  time 

horizon expands it is reasonable to think that prediction power of the model will decline due to 

uncertainty.  This  is  what  actually  was  found  in  the  paper.  For  all  other  time  periods  ratings 

9 

 

turned out to be inferior to the used model except the longest one, but ratings performance over 

model  in  this  case  is  negligibly  higher.  As  for  the  second  question,  namely  whether  ratings 

incorporate information for market risk authors constructed specific measure called failure beta. 

They  obtained  that  there  is  strong  correlation  between  this  measure  and  rating  classes.  More 

specifically,  failure  beta grows as rating class quality declines (from the highest to the  lowest). 

This  fact proves that ratings are good indicators of  market risk. To conclude, authors state that 

rating agencies do not incorporate all relevant information about default probability into ratings 

but they turned out to be good predictors of market risk. 

In Figlewski et al (2012) authors consider how various macroeconomic variables together 

with firm-linked ones effect on default probability among rating classes. The main instrument for 

this  purpose  was  Cox  hazard  model  in  reduced  form.  It  should  be  noted  that  sample  of  debts 

utilized in the paper was extracted from Moody’s Default Risk Service database which is similar 

to  those  used  in  the  master  thesis.  As  the  result  author  stated  that  rating  classes  incorporate 

probability  of  default  properly  for  each  rating  category  and  predictive  power  of  the  model 

increases with utilization of macroeconomic variables. This fact is in line with previous studies. 

In  addition  the  higher  the  initial  rating  results  in  the  lower  probability  for  such  bond  to 

experience a default event as well as to be downgraded. Another important conclusion is about 

effects  connected  with  time  to  maturity  –  default  intensity  depends  on  this  bond  specific 

characteristic,  namely  the  longer  the  time  horizon  the  higher  the  probability  of  default,  which 

seems to be quite reasonable. 

The  last  paper  in  this  subsection  mostly  refers  not  to  the  default  frequency  and  rating 

classes  but  actually  to  inconsistently  rated  issues.  This  study  is  important  since  in  the  master 

thesis  author  also  calculated  inconsistently  rated  issues  and  paper  may  provide  with  some 

insights. Perraudin and Taylor (2004) considered sample of 1430 straight US dollar denominated 

bonds that satisfied to some particular requirements. For these issues Nelson  – Siegel algorithm 

was  implemented  to  extract  term  structures  for  yields  of  different  rating  classes  on  everyday 

basis. In addition yield curves for different maturities were also constructed. Using term structure 

of interest rates  fitted bond prices were calculated and  based on them  misclassified issues were 

defined.  Finally,  authors  found that about 25% “AA”  bonds  have  misclassified rating.  Authors 

claimed that such substantial amount of misclassified issues may be due to significant effect of 

unaccounted risk premiums or taxes which have effectively make impact on discount rates. After 

accounting for these factors authors decreased number of inconsistently rated bonds considerably 

but it still remains significant.

1.2.  Examination  of  information  about  loss  given  default  contained  in 

assigned ratings 

There  are  a  few  major  papers  that  author  found  which  investigate  the  empirical 

relationship  between  loss  given  default  (and  equivalently  recovery  rate)  and  rating  classes. 

Explanation  of  this  phenomenon  is  that  rating  agencies  introduced  this  measure  only  after 

numerous  default  numbers  during  past  financial  crisis.  Before  that  is  was  broadly  common  to 

assume that probability of default and recovery are not correlated. The recent crisis showed that 

it is quite strong and unreasonable assumption. Moreover, estimated recoveries  are published by 

agencies  only  for  small  amount of  issues  that are rated and author was unable to find out why 

rating agencies do not publish estimated recoveries for the rest debts. 

As  in  above  review  for  default  probability  results  from  the  articles  are  not  in  line  with 

each other. The first paper was already discussed; it is Altman (1989) where author specified that 

there is no dependence between first assigned rating and realized recovery after default. Also it 

was  stated  that  if  one  considers  subsamples  of  non-investment  and  investment  grade  bonds 

separately the result remains unchanged indicating that there is no relationship irrespectively for 

these subclasses. 

In  paper  by  Carey  (1998)  author  investigates  main  features  of  bond  portfolios  – 

distribution of losses given specific issue risk. Sample consists of  debts covering period 1986 – 

1992. This issue specific risk is estimated via supervisory ratings. As the result Carey states that 

distribution of losses has poor correlation with debt classes which supports Alman’s conclusion. 

The next paper is of the recent ones. In Bade et al (2011) it is stated that there should be 

strong correlation between rating classes and recoveries. In this article Heckman-type regression 

model was  introduced for simultaneous estimation of default probability and recovery rate. Set 

of  explanatory  variables  consisted  of  ratings  itself  and  broad  set of  macroeconomic  indicators. 

The  choice  for  the  model  was  made  for  Heckman  regression  because  on  the  used  sample 

(obtained  from  Moody’s  database  for  US  issues)  authors  found  significant  correlation  between 

recoveries at default and probabilities of  such events, thus they were  intended to estimate both 

parameters simultaneously. In paper mentioned one possible explanation of phenomenon that in 

previous  studies  no  correlation  for  recoveries  and  rating  classes  was  found  –  recovery  rate  is 

observable only for defaulted issues and is not defined for non-defaulted ones. Therefore, it may 

be  the  case  that  previous  papers  suffered  from  biased  data.  Estimating  the  introduced  model 

authors  claimed  that  they  considered  this  problem  carefully  when  studied  the  empirical 

relationship.  In  addition,  four  different  subtypes  of  model  were  estimated  and  some  of  them 

turned  out to  have  high  explanatory  power.  In  these  models  parameter  lambda  was  significant 

 

11 

and  it  is  explicit  proof  that  results  of  the  model  correctly  accounts  for  correlation  between 

recoveries and probability of default. 

Varma et al (2003) presented a special comment from Moody’s research division which 

also gives the evidence that recovery rates are correlated with rating classes  – there  is positive 

relationship  indicating  that  recoveries  decline  for  lower  quality  rating  classes,  the  highest  ones 

are  for  AAA  issues  and  monotonously  go  down  for  non-investment  grade  bonds.  The  sample 

used consisted of corporate debts only covering defaults happened in period from 2000 to 2003. 

All  computational  process  was  conducted  for  equally  weighted  and  value  weighted  portfolios. 

The  last  one  was  implemented  to  check  whether  ratings  perform  better  for  issues  wit h  higher 

outstanding amount and it was found that defaults on higher volume issues are followed by lower 

recoveries. This is reasonable to study these two cases separately and in this master thesis author 

implemented both approaches. The sample used was again Moody’s DRS database and consisted 

of both bonds and preferred stocks, although number of stocks is quite small (111 compared to 

2500 for bonds). In spite of found positive relation it is mentioned that results are not extremely 

robust. 

Altman  and  Kishore  (1996)  present  a  comprehensive  research  on  recovery  rates.  There 

are many variables that potentially may influence the recovery, the most important ones are: 

  Debt seniority – as it was pointed out, on average in the sample recoveries decline with 

decrease  in  seniority.  This  is  quite  reasonable  to  assume,  since  in  case  of  default 

bondholders with the  highest priority claims (senior secured) will receive  more because 

they are paid first 

  Debt industry also should affect the recovery. The highest recovery rates are observed for 

utilities, chemicals, petroleum and  food industries. This seems reasonable  since even  in 

case of default products of companies from these industries will be in demand thus would 

give the ability for business to recover more value. 

Tests  for  statistical  significance  conducted  in  the  article  proved  that  debt  seniority  and 

belonging to particular industry describes diverse recovery rates. Nevertheless, authors note that 

rating  class  has  no  impact  on  recovery  taking  explicitly  under  consideration  debt  seniority 

(considering separately investment and non-investment grade categories). 

 

In  Altman  et  al  (2005)  authors  analyzed  the  relation  between  default  probabilities  and 

loss given default using on corporate bonds sample. As it was mentioned earlier, before the crisis 

2008 the vast majority of empirical studies as well as practical models treated default frequency 

and  recovery  rates  as  uncorrelated  variables.  Functional  dependence  of  recoveries  was  based 

only on previously observed recoveries, sometimes collateral and bond seniority were also taken 

into account. Nevertheless, authors in 2005 on used data managed to obtain the results that such 
12 

 

approach  has  to  be  changed  due  to  presence  of  correlation  between  these  variables.  Statistical 

models  used  were  able  to  describe  the  most  part  of  variation  in  recovery  rates  using  default 

frequencies,  debt  classes  and  backing  indicators  as  explanatory  variables.  This  leads  to  very 

important conclusion for risk-managers and credit analysts. 

2.  Methodologies  of  rating  agencies  for  default  probability  and 

loss given default estimation 

2.1.  Moody’s methodology 

Moody’s  methodology  is  described  in  more  details  than  Standard  &  Poor’s  and  Fitch 

ones for two reasons:  first is because author used sample extracted from Moody’s database and 

second  because  the  rest  two  agency’s  methodologies  have  more  in  common  that  each  of  them 

with Moody’s. 

As  it  is  stated  in  Moody’s  corporate  brochure:  “credit  ratings  are  opinions  of  the  credit 

quality  of  individual  obligations  or  of  an  issuer’s  general  creditworthiness”  (Moody’s  Ratings 

Symbols  and  Definitions,  2009,  p.1).  Thus,  agency  assigns  ratings  analyzing 

total 

creditworthiness  of  the  issuer,  its  ability  to  repay  the  debt  on  its  own,  possibility  to  obtain 

support  from  the  parent  structure  (if  it  is  applied),  accounting  data,  open  information  sources  

and  information  that  the  issuer  provides  on  the  meetings.  Some  of  these  factors  have  higher 

weight  but  these  weights  are  not  determined  beforehand.  As  Moody’s  says  each  issuer  is 

analyzed separately and methodology has only general scheme. 

For  default  probability  and  loss  given  default  estimation  Moody’s  uses  original 

approaches: 

  For  default  probability  is  utilized  Moody’s  KMV  RiskCalc  v.3.1  model.  This  model  uses 

accounting information for particular company, namely ratios for profitability, leverage, debt 

coverage,  liquidity  etc.  as  inputs  for  KMV  model  (which  is  practical  implementation  of 

Merton’s model 1974). Through KMV structural model these indicators are transformed into 

distance  to  default  which  is  then  mapped  with  expected  default  probability  using  own 

proprietary default database. This model is purely econometric. 

  For loss given default – Moody’s LossCalc V2 model. This model is also purely econometric 

and  as  inputs  it  requires  data  on  debt  backing  as  well  as  possible  support  from  the  parent 

structure, class of the debt, firm- and industry-specific variables and finally macro indicators. 

For the  last one are used dummies  for states and the same distance to default as  in previous 

model.  Model  also  uses  proprietary  database  for  realized  recoveries  for  bonds,  loans  and 

preferred stocks. The aim is to estimate the market price of debt in 30 days after default event. 
13 

 

There  is  discrete  time  period  scale  for  which  estimates  are  produced:  Moody’s  assesses 

recovery  as  if  default  would  have  happened  at  the  very  moment  and  after  1  year  from  the 

moment. 

As  it  was  mentioned  above  approach  for  estimation  is  based  on  statistical  information. 

Crucial  point  here  is  that  in  spite  of  highlighted correlation  between  probability  of  default  and 

recovery rate as articles state (which is simply one less loss given default) Moody’s is estimating 

these two variables separately. 

Moody’s defines recovery rate as percentage of par value which constitutes market price 

of defaulted issue 30 days after default event. As for default the definition is the following: 

“a  missed  or  deferred  payment  of  interest  and/or  principal,  <…>  bankruptcy,  administration, 

legal receivership, or other legal  blocks, a distressed exchange occurs where the  issuer offers a 

new  security  or  package  of  securities  of  lower  amount  <…>  or  the  exchange  had  the  apparent 

purpose  of  helping  the  borrower  avoid  default”  (“Frequently  Asked  Questions”,  Moody’s 

Corporate Default Risk Service, p.1) 

 

Having estimated rating for the particular issue Moody’s uses the following procedure to 

determine the rating for a bond: agency adjusts issuer’s rating in upward or downward direction 

based on difference between estimated LGD and LGD for set of issuers from the same industry. 

Moody’s claims that only relative values of LGD are vital for rating assignment. LGD ranking as 

well as rating scheme are the following

Thus, Moody’s ratings implicitly account for recovery rates through loss given default as 

indicated  above.  Using  this  result  it  makes  reasonable  to  compare  information  contained  in 

ratings about probability of default and recoveries with realized lifetime loss measure that will be 

introduced  in  Chapter  2.  This  measure  as  it  will  be  shown  includes  these  both  parameters  by 

construction.

2.2.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch methodology 

Both  rating  agencies  again  claim  that  assigned  ratings  reflect  opinions  of  their  analysts 

about credit risk. “Standard & Poor’s ratings express the agency’s opinion about the ability 

and  willingness  of  an  issuer,  such  as  a  corporation  or  state  or  city  government,  to  meet  its 

financial  obligations  in  full  and  on  time”  (“Guide  to  Credit  Rating  Essentials”,  Standard  & 

Poor’s,  p.5).  Indicators  which  are  used  by  these  agencies  for  credit  rating  estimation  are  very 

similar to those which Moody’s uses.  

Standard & Poor’s and Fitch as well as Moody’s  may use technical  analysis  in order to 

determine  ratings  but  only  as  a  component  for  the  process,  “Ratings  Not  Determined  by 

Models.<…> The importance of a model in generating rating opinions ranges from substantial to 

minor”  (“Managing  and  Developing  Criteria  and  Models”  Fitch  Ratings,  2011,  p.1).  S&P  and 

Fitch also have separate approaches for default probability and recovery rates estimation but on 

contrary  to  Moody’s  their  approaches  are  based  on  fundamentals  and  not  on  statistics  (like 

modeling  changes  in  future  cash  flows,  possible  path  for  company’s  asset  values  etc.). 

Nevertheless, agencies admit that they may use the same subset of indicators for both probability 

of default and loss given default. These approaches have implied limitations – they have extreme 

dependence on analyst’s assumptions. Also, S&P and Fitch are estimating the value of the issue 

at  the  end  of  bankruptcy  period  while  Moody’s  estimates  market  price  30  days  after  default 

event. 

Rating  process  again  incudes  issue  analysis  with  preliminary  rating  assignment  and 

afterwards take  place  process  called  “notching”.  It  is  very  similar  to  adjustment  technique  that 

uses  Moody’s,  although  matching  scales  are  different:  S&P  has  seven  instead  of  six  levels  of 

recoveries.  Also,  S&P  and  Fitch  adjust  ratings  using  estimated  recoveries  while  Moody’s  uses 

loss given default. Nevertheless, due to unambiguous relationship between those two indicators 

such  difference  seems  to  be  not  very  important.  Notching  standards  for  S&P  and  Fitch 

respectively are listed below

3.  Conclusions for Chapter 1 

1.  Existing  literature  presents  very  controversial  conclusions  on  relationship  between 

default probability and rating classes as well as recovery rates and debt ratings. 

2.  Nevertheless, the trend in presented articles is the following: 

- 

from  the  beginning  of  studies  on  default  probability  to  nowadays  number  of 

articles  in which argued  strong correlation  between default  frequency  and rating 

classes increased 

-  almost  all  papers  present  statement  that  ratings  are  good  indicators  for  default 

probability, although  in  some of them authors argue that  ratings all alone do not 

explain defaults and suggest to use additional explanatory variables 

3.  All  three  rating  agencies  have  their  own  approach  for  default  probability  and  recovery 

(loss given default for Moody’s). Approaches have similar trait – first step is preliminary 

rating  assignment,  second  is  to  make  an  adjustment  for that rating  using  estimated  loss 

given default or recovery rates. The most crucial difference among agencies is how they 

estimate recovery rates: 

-  Moody’s  uses  purely  statistical  approach  based  on  KMV  model  for  loss  given 

default assessment 

-  Standard & Poor’s as well as Fitch conduct quantitative estimation process based 

on various expectations about future outcomes  for balance sheet  items and other 

indicators

Chapter  2.  Empirical  research  on  credit  ratings  classes  and 
information contained in ratings 

Credit  ratings  emerged  more  than  century  ago  as  an  assessment  of  risk  associated  with 

particular debtor. They present an opinion of credit rating agency about the credit quality of the 

debt  issuer  which  reflects  ability  to  meet  the  obligations.  The  measure  of  risk  incorporated  in 

obligation  is  closely  associated  with  likelihood  that  the  issuer  will  default.  Therefore,  having 

historical data on the pool of securities one should find the correlation between assigned ratings 

and  default  frequencies  in  the  sample.  In  their  methodologies,  credit  rating  agencies  typically 

plot such graphs indicating that the most part of happened defaults are concentrated amongst low 

rated issues. If this is the case then it may be interpreted as the evidence that agencies do make 

accurate forecasts on default probabilities.  

The empirical question that arises  is what would  be the appropriate way to estimate the 

quality of ratings? Is it enough just simply to count defaults as credit rating agencies frequently 

report.  Or  maybe  the  quality  of  ratings  is  better  reflected  by  realized  recovery  or  alternatively 

loss given default? Perhaps it is the case empirically that default frequency in a given rating class 

and  loss  given  default  in  the  same  rating  class  are  highly  correlated.  In  that  case,  the  default 

experience alone would be a sufficient statistic on the goodness of a rating. But if the correlation 

is low, both statistics could give different answers about the goodness of the ratings of a rating 

agency. 

In the real world investors vary with their risk appetite. Such investors may be interested 

not  only  in  likelihood  that  particular  issuer  would  go  into  default  but  also  when  default  will 

occur and what the recovery rate would be. In this paper author proposes alternative measure for 

quality  of  credit  ratings  called  realized  lifetime  loss.  This  measure  as  its  name  indicates 

compares  actually  made  payments  during  the  lifetime  of  the  bond  with  “promised”  payments. 

The idea for this measure was introduced by Richard Hainsworth in the unpublished paper “The 

meaning of ratings”. The goal of this paper was to test this new measure on the real data to find 

how well does it perform. 

According to the realized lifetime loss promised payments are simply ones scheduled  in 

final terms of the  issue.  It could  be calculated as  “one”  minus the ratio of the present value of 

realized cash flows and the present value of promised cash flows. In this case, it would show the 

percentage of promised payment that was actually lost by the bondholder. Another way is to use 

difference  between  promised  and  realized  payments  which  will  be  the  loss  indicator  of  lost 

amount of money. This measure has several preferences over simple method of default counting 

like:  can  be  calculated  for  all  bonds  (not  only  for  defaulted  as  recovery  rate)  thus  it  avoids 

 

17 

selection  bias  and  may  be  used  in  regression  analysis  for  the  whole  sample,  has  direct 

relationship with lifetime of the issue, i.e. time to maturity for non-defaulted and time to default 

for the rest etc. 

1.  Descriptive statistics of the sample used 

The  main  source  of  the  data  was  Moody’s  Default  Risk  Service  (DRS)  proprietary 

database created on November 11th, 2010. This database  is  Microsoft Access  format and  is the 

same source of data that is used by Moody’s analysts for rating assignment research. It contains 

16  distinct  tables  describing  all  Moody’s  rated  debts,  corresponding  issuers,  defaults  history, 

watch 

lists  etc.  More  comprehensive  description  could  be  found 

in  DRS  Technical 

Specifications. 

Initially DRS database  contained of 442818 debts  from 34340 distinct  issuers. The data 

spans  from 1970 to the date of database creation. Numbers of constraints were  imposed on the 

initial sample to make it satisfying for the requirements of this research. They are the following: 

1.  Leave only bonds since the paper is dedicated to bond analysis  

2.  Exclude all debts without record of coupon rate (needed for realized lifetime loss)  

3.  Moody’s reported that since 1982 methodology changed significantly, restrict sale date to 

be  later  than  1982.  Also  drop  all  bonds  without  record  for  maturity  date  (needed  for 

realized lifetime loss) 

4.  For calculation purposes needed data on issuers domicile 

5.  For regression analysis needed information about industry 

6.  First  assigned  rating  is  in  1982  (for  realized  lifetime  loss  and  Lorenz  curves  since 

methodology changed in 1982) 

7.  Author was interested in examining rating quality of long term ratings, thus all short term 

and  provisional  ratings  were  excluded  (the  last  ones  excluded  due  to  fact  that  they 

constituted a very small amount in the sample and only part of them was later assigned a 

“regular” rating) 

8.  For realized lifetime loss one needs proper discount rates. Author calculated this measure 

only for U.S. debts for two reasons: U.S. bonds constitute the vast majority of sample and 

discount rates for such issues can be easily obtained for broad list of maturities. 

Also to analyze value weighted portfolio needed the record on bond’s face value. 

All  debts  with  variable  and  unknown  frequencies  were  excluded  for  computational 

purposes. 

 

18 

Also technical defaults were excluded. Default types are shown  in  Appendix 2. Default 

was considered to be technical for the following combinations of default type – resolution 

types – bankruptcy types:  

Grace period default – * – * (* stands for any value of the item) 

Missed  interest payment  – Made Interest Payment/Creditors paid  in  full/Made principal 

payment – * 

Missed  principal  and  interest  payments  –  Null/Creditors  paid  in  full/Made  principal 

payment/Made interest payment – * 

9.  Subsample of defaulted bonds consists of the following frequencies:  monthly, quarterly, 

semiannual,  annual  and  accrued.  As  for  bonds  from  non-defaulted  subsample,  their 

frequencies take the same values plus additional ones: biweekly, bimonthly, and biannual 

(for  instance,  biannual  bond  pays  coupon  every  two  years).  Author  counted  number  of 

such  bonds  and  come  up  with  the  following  numbers:  1  for  biweekly,  1  for  bimonthly 

and 39 for biannual. These 1 + 1 + 39 = 41 bonds represent a negligible amount in non-

defaulted subsample, so author decided to exclude them to make frequency types  among 

two subsamples identical. 

10. Due to significant discrepancies in methodologies only corporate bonds were left 

Finally  sample  consisted  of  47398  debts  (19055  from  financial  and  28343  from  non-

financial  sectors),  1664  defaulted  debts  (436  and  1228  defaults  in  financial  and  non-

financial subsamples respectively) and 5854 issuers.

conclusion that all other cases, except three ones  listed  in subentry 8 above, resulted  in 

default on  bond (to avoid  here  misunderstanding,  in each  scenario  bankruptcy type was 

such that is was non-technical default)

2.  The methodology and obtained results 

2.1. 

Investigation  of  relationship  between  rating  classes  and  default 

frequency 

The  first  question  that  arises  is  whether  quality  of  assigned  ratings  can  be  assessed  by 

simply  counting  number  of  defaulted  debts  as  rating  agencies  often  report.  For  this  purpose 

author  plotted  graphs  that  show  the  relationship  between  cumulative  share  of  different  rating 

classes  in  total  defaults  number  and  cumulative  share  of  different  rating  classes  in  total  debts 

number for two cases: equally weighted portfolio and value weighted portfolio. For the first case 

author  simply  calculated  share  of  bonds  in  each  rating  class  treating  them  as  having  the  same 

face values, and in the second case author utilized issue’s  recorded face value as a measure for 

assigning weight. To clarify the last point, used face value is the total issue value that is recorded 

in Moody’s Default Risk Service database, for instance, if bond’s face value is 100 and issue size 

was 5000 then used face value is equal to 500000. 

For equally weighted portfolio all auxiliary steps can be summarized as follows: 

 

20 

-  Take the subsample of defaulted bonds, calculate shares of each rating class (C, Ca, Caa, 

B,  Ba,  Baa,  A,  Aa,  Aaa)  in  this  subsample  simply  dividing  number  of  issues  from  a 

particular class by total number of issues in subsample 

-  Calculate  cumulative  shares  of  this  rating  classes  in  subsample  of  defaulted  bonds,  i.e. 

cumulative  share  for  C  class  is  simply  its  share  in  subsample  of  defaulted  issues, 

cumulative  share  of  Ca  class  is  cumulative  share  of  C  class  plus  share  of  Ca  issues  in 

defaulted subsample, etc. 

-  Do the same steps but use the whole sample instead of only sample with defaulted issues 

-  Plot  cumulative  shares  calculated  for  defaulted  subsample  against  cumulative  shares  of 

the same classes calculated for the whole sample 

For  value  weighted  portfolio  the  algorithm  is  essentially  the  same  with  one  minor 

exception: for this case author calculated shares of ratings classes by summing up face values of 

issues  in particular rating class and then dividing  by the total  face value of  issues  in the whole 

sample (for share in the whole sample) or by the face value of issues in defaulted subsample (for 

share in the defaulted subsample). Then author calculated cumulative shares as described in case 

of equally weighted portfolio. 

Such plot  is called a cumulative accuracy plot also known as  Lorenz curve. If  assigned 

ratings  contain  no  relevant  data  about  likelihood  of  default,  the  curve  on  average  would  be 

diagonal. On contrary, if ratings possess a perfect information about default, only issues with the 

lowest ratings would default (i.e. they accumulate all defaults happened in the sample). 

For  the  purpose  of  accuracy  estimation  author  used  broadly  utilized  definition  of 

accuracy ratio (Gini coefficient) defined as ratio of the area between the empirical curve and the 

straight diagonal line (random model) over the area between ideal case and random model. 

Also,  considering  this  case  author’s  intention  was  to  investigate  whether  the  rating 

agencies better assess quality of  issues over the  shorter horizon than  in the  long run. This was 

done  by  plotting  the  same  graphs  described  above  (equally  and  value  weighted  portfolios)  for 

cases when bonds gone into default in period less than 1 year after initial rating assignment and 

for the case when default happened after 1 year. 

Sample used  is the  same as described  in this chapter. This  sample consists of corporate 

debts only. Nevertheless, these bonds are from both financial (commercial and investment banks, 

brokerages  etc.)  and  non-financial  industries.  Rating  methodologies  have  some  differences  for 

these industries, namely accounting standards and disclosure requirements are different for banks 

and non-banks. That is why when rating agencies perform their credit analysis they operate with 

different indicators and in different ways for these two industries.

Results  for  relationship  between  default  frequency  and  first  assigned  rating  for  the 

subsample  of  debts  from  financial  industry  is  shown  in  diagrams  1  and  2.  Here  and  thereafter 

marks “Ca” – “Aaa” on diagrams denote the right end of the interval, for instance, “Baa” denotes 

the cumulative share of all Baa rated issues. That is it is the share of Ca, Caa, B, Ba, Baa bonds 

in total amount.

As  for equally weighted  portfolio, diagrams  for the  horizon  less than 1  year and  after 1 

year from initial rating assignment are skipped again for the same reason. 

The same approach was applied for the subsample of debts from non-financial industry.

The source: author’s calculations based on Moody’s DRS database 

It  can  be  seen  from  the  diagrams  for  sample  that  includes  only  debts  from  financial 

industry  assigned  ratings  on  average  contain  information  for  default  probability  but  ratings 

should be used together with some other explanatory variables: 

-  Gini coefficients take moderate values (around 0.55 for all cases under consideration) 

-  due to high regulation and government support financial  subsample consisted  mostly of 

- 

- 

the  highest  rated  debts  (roughly  less  than  90%  of  total  issues  are  “A”-“Aaa”  rated, the 

rest are Ba-Baa). The highest defaults number is in “A” category (81%) which is due to 

the fact that sample horizon includes 2008 crisis when a lot of high rated banks defaulted 

this may be the evidence that rating agencies do not properly take into account all risks of 

the financial industry and methodology should be adjusted 

ratings better reflect default probability for value weighted portfolio as measured by Gini 

coefficients  although  there  is  no  big  difference.  It  means  that  rating  agencies  assess 

slightly  better  higher  volume  issues.  This  relationship  becomes  even  stronger  for  the 

short run in this case but it is not observed for equally weighted portfolio 

 

Results for non-financial subsample differ dramatically:  

-  we  see  that  equally  weighted  portfolio  performs  much  better  in  this  case  than  for 

financial  subsample.  It  is  the  evidence  that  in  spite  of  past  crisis  ratings  methodology 

properly accounts for possible risks in non-financial industry 

- 

ratings predictive power (accuracy coefficients) for default probability dramatically rises 

on the 1 year horizon for both equally and value weighted portfolios. It means that ratings 

itself are sufficient predictors in the short run 

25 

 

-  value  weighted  portfolio  demonstrates  poorer  performance  for  non-financial  industry 

compared to equally weighted one, which indicates that lower size issues are rated better 

The results for both subsamples are in line with Altman (1989) in sense that there exists 

strong evidence that ratings possess  information  of default probability,  for  financial  subsample 

are partially consistent with Godlewski (2007). The most probable explanation for the last is that 

in Godlewski sample’s time period had not overlapped with crisis 2008 (on contrary with sample 

used in master thesis) as well as his model did not took into account economy cycles. The results 

are  also  in  good  match  with  Brude  and  Gonzales-Aguado  (2010)  which  explains  significant 

defaults  number  in  financial  debts  subsample.  Also  better  performance  of  ratings  on  1  year 

horizon is line with Hilscher and Wilson (2013) and Figlewski et al (2012) 

2.2. 

Investigation  of  relationship  between  rating  classes  and  loss  given 
default 

The  second  question  that  arises  is  whether  credit  ratings  reflect  any  additional 

information  namely  if  they  can  be  used  for  prediction  of  recovery  rate  at  default  or  loss  given 

default, since these two measures are connected via relationship LGD = 1 – RR. For this purpose 

author  plotted  graphs  that  show  the  relationship  between  cumulative  share  of  different  rating 

classes  in  total  loss  given  default  and  cumulative  share  of  different  rating  classes  in  total 

defaulted debts number. The crucial point here which  makes the  main difference with previous 

part  that  author  had  to  work only  with  defaulted  subsample,  since  LGD  is  observable  only  for 

defaulted  issues.  Again,  two  cases  were  considered  separately:  equally  weighted  portfolio  and 

value  weighted  portfolio.  Issue’s  recorded  face  value  was  utilized  as  a  measure  for  assigning 

weight. 

Calculation steps for equally weighted portfolio: 

-  Consider only subsample of defaulted bonds 

-  Calculate shares of each rating class (C, Ca, Caa, B, Ba, Baa,  A, Aa, Aaa)  in total  loss 

given default of the subsample, assuming all face values equal (for instance, equal to 1) 

-  Calculate  cumulative  shares  of  this  rating  classes  in  total  loss  given  default,  i.e. 

cumulative  share  for  C  class  is  simply  its  share  in  total  loss  given  default  of  the 

subsample, cumulative share of Ca class is cumulative share of C class plus share of Ca 

issues in total loss given default of the subsample, etc. 

-  Calculate  shares  of  each  rating  class  (C,  Ca,  Caa,  B,  Ba,  Baa,  A,  Aa,  Aaa)  in  this 

subsample  simply  dividing  number  of  issues  from  a  particular  class  by  total  number  of 

issues in subsample 

-  Calculate cumulative shares of this rating classes in subsample as was described above 

 

26 

For value weighted portfolio the algorithm is almost identical with the difference that in 

this scenario author used “true” face values recorded in the database (these are issue face values 

not bond ones). The reason to apply both methods is to investigate the sensitivity with respect to 

size of the issue. This is reasonable since treatment of all bonds as having the same face value is 

quite a strong assumption as well as using indicator for issue size helps to find out whether rating 

quality differs for issues amongst the size. 

Accuracy  was again  assessed with Gini  coefficients, as well  as approach of considering 

defaults happened in period less than 1 year after rating assignment and after 1 year. 

Results  for  relationship  between  loss  given  default  and  first  assigned  rating  for  sample 

consisting of financial industry debts is shown in diagram 7 to diagram 8

Diagram  for defaults happened  in period after 1 year  from  first rating assignment is not 

presented here because it makes no difference compared to diagram for the whole sample. 

Author also performed the same analysis for value weighted portfolio. The diagrams for 

this  case  are  not  shown  here  because  their  shapes  repeat  the  respective  diagrams  for  equally 

weighted portfolio. The reader can get acquainted with accuracy coefficients for both cases from 

the table which will be listed below in the text. 

The results for non-financial subsample are a bit different (diagrams 9 and 10) from the 

financial debts and need a brief discussion:

Diagrams for the defaults occurred in period after 1 year since first rating assignment are 

not  shown  again  for  the  same  reason.  It  is  interesting  whether  ratings  reflect  better  loss  given 

default for issues with higher weight. For such purpose author also performed analysis for value 

weighted portfolio. Very similar results were obtained, so they are not given here.

The source: author’s calculations based on Moody’s DRS database 

Red dotted line on all diagrams presents the case when on average there is no relationship 

between  accumulated  loss  given  default  and  rating  classes.  It  can  be  obtained  by  sufficiently 

large  number  of  simulations  of  random  relationship  between  LGD  and  ratings  and  then 

averaging  over  all  of  them.  That  is  why  negative  Gini  coefficients  mean  that  on  average 

relationship in data is inferior to one explained by random model. The results can be summarized 

as follows: 

- 

subsample  of  financial  industry  debts  shows  no  relationship  between  LGD  and  rating 

classes. This conclusion is true for all time horizons and both equally and value weighted 

portfolios.  Diagrams  illustrate  that  for  LGD  prediction  one  has  to  employ  additional 

explanatory variables 

- 

subsample of non-financial industry debts indicates that there is the relationship between 

assigned  ratings  and  time  horizon.  Gini  coefficients  significantly  exceed  0  for  defaults 

happened  in  1  year  period  but  still  take  moderate  values.  This  result  states  that  for  the 

short  run  ratings  contain  some  information  about  LGD  but  one  still  needs  to  use 

additional  information  LGD  estimation  for  that  period.  There  is  almost  no  difference 

between  equally  and  value  weighed  portfolios  which  means  that  issue  size  has  no 
29 

 

substantial  impact  on  realized  LGD.  Nevertheless,  in  the  long  run  as  diagrams  indicate 

ratings are not reliable indicators of LGD 

Demonstrated results are in perfect match with Altman (1989), Carey (1998) for financial 

subsample for all time horizons and in long run for non-financial one. The outcome on average 

contradicts to Bade et al (2011) but is partially consistent with article in sense that demonstrates 

relationship for non-financial subsample in the short run. Explanation is that in the article authors 

made  correction  for  bias  in data caused  by property or recoveries  – they  are observed only  for 

defaulted debts and approach used in this work does not take it into account. Another reason that 

obtained results  are  for initially assigned ratings  and  in article authors also used altered ratings 

during the lifetime of debt. Also, results for non-financial subsample for value weighted portfolio 

are  in  line  with  Varma  et  al  (2003)  –  value  weighted  portfolio  performs  worse  thus  indicating 

lower recoveries for higher weighted issues. 

3.  Conclusions for Chapter 2 

1.  Author came to the conclusion that ratings indeed can be used as indicators for default 

frequency, this fact is in line with number of studies. 

-  Nevertheless, for financial debts subsample 

a)  Lorenz  curves  and  Gini  coefficients  imply  that  some  other  explanatory 

variables should be used for default probability prediction 

b)  this subsample consists mostly of “A”-“Aaa” rated issues and the most part 

of which suffered default events 

c)  it is consequence of risks underestimation revealed by financial crisis 2008 

-  For  non-financial  industry  issues  there  is  evidence  that  rating  methodology 

correctly takes into account risks inherent in bonds and ratings itself can be used 

as a single predictor for default probability. This result becomes even stronger in 

the short run. 

2.  There  is a completely different situation with  information  contained  in  ratings  for  loss 

given default 

-  diagrams indicate that on average ratings are inadequate source of information for 

that  purpose  and  predictive  power  in  the  long  horizon  is  negligible  for  both 

financial and non-financial industries 

- 

- 

it was shown that ratings can be used at least as one of the explanatory factors for 

LGD prediction in the short run for non-financial debts 

this is the case since they still contain some piece of information as Lorenz curves 

and Gini coefficients imply.

Chapter 3. Empirical research on presence of additional 
information in credit ratings 

Realized  lifetime  loss  measure  is  used  in  this  paper  as  an  alternative  to  probability  of 

default. Employment of this measure can be justified for the next two reasons: 

-  Due  to  Moody’s  definition  of  default,  debt  restructuring  situation  with  the  following 

significant  loss  of  value,  for  instance  70%  and  case  when  company  defaults  but  then 

afterwards  manages  to  repay  the  most  part  of  the  debt,  i.e.  case  when  present  value  of 

payments  suffers  not  too  much  are  treated  equally  as  default.  For  legal  purposes  these 

two events may be named as default but for ordinary investor such cases are indeed not 

the same. Thus, if ratings reflect only probability of default such information would not 

be enough for investor who is interested also in type of default 

-  This  measure  takes  into  account  what  fraction  the  investment  could  be  repaid  i.e. 

recovery in case of default as well as it implicitly depends on time when default occurred 

Therefore,  evaluation  of  ratings  quality  based  only  on  historical  default  frequency  may 

not be the optimal way nowadays. As it was pointed out in previous sections information about 

default probability is contained in ratings and is reliable but ratings poorly predict possible loss 

given default. Investor probably would like to know both estimates for the bond but the problem 

is how to choose the issue for example out of two with very close ratings and estimated losses (if 

it was possible) if they still different. For instance, if according to Standard & Poor’s scale one 

issue  is  AA  rated  and  has  level  3  of  estimated  recovery  and  the  other  is  AA-  rated  and  has 

estimate  of  level  2  for  recovery  rate,  recovery  rates  are  scaled  in  such  way  that the  higher  the 

number the better is the recovery. Having these two pieces of information it is not quite clear in 

which bond it would be more appropriate to invest. The realized lifetime loss implicitly accounts 

for default event and explicitly  for recovery and thus this combine  measure  may  be helpful  for 

such situation. 

1.  Investigation  of  relationship  between  rating  classes  and 

realized lifetime loss 

It was already mentioned realized lifetime loss is based on present value of promised and 

realized cash flows. In order to calculate it one needs to obtain set of appropriate discount rates. 

Author  made  an  assumption  about  the  investor  type.  In  this  paper  realized  lifetime  loss  was 

calculated  from the viewpoint of an  investor with a perfect foresight. Such  investor has perfect 

knowledge  about  stream  of  cash  flow  which  bond  will  provide  him,  that  is  he  knows  exactly 

amount  and  schedule  of  coupons  and  face  value  paid  in  case  of  no  default  and  in  case  when 

default  happens  he  knows  time  when  he  will  get  the  recovery  value  and  preceding  coupons.

Using this assumption all payments were discounted with US government bond yields1 which are 

reliable proxies for risk free rates. They are listed in Appendix 3. 

For  non-defaulted  issues  realized  lifetime  loss  was  set  0  by  definition.  For  issues 

experienced a default event two closely connected definitions of realized lifetime loss were used 

in this paper. The first one is 

   

    ∑

 

  

           

 

      

  

              ∑

 

  

           

                  

         

 

which is actually equal to present value lost due to default event. 

t  –  time  interval  between  date  when  bond  was  sold  and  every  coupon  payment  (expressed  in 

years),  t  increases  for  each  summand  by  365/(coupon  frequency  indicator),  where  coupon 

frequency indicator equals 12, 4, 2 and 1 for monthly, quarterly, semiannually and annually paid 

coupons  respectively.  For  accrued  frequency  the  coupon  and  face  value  were  paid  at  maturity 

simultaneously and discounted with rate for maturity 

Ct – coupon payment at this moment equal (coupon rate/coupon frequency indicator)*face value 

for monthly, quarterly, semiannually and annually paid coupons and coupon rate*face value for 

accrued frequency (such bond simply pays face value plus coupon simultaneously at maturity) 

T – time interval between date when bond was sold and maturity date (expressed in years) 

Tdef  –  time  interval  between  date  when  bond  was  sold  and  date  of  default  plus  30  days,  since 

market value was estimated 30 days after default (expressed in years) 

f – time interval between date when bond was sold and date when face value was paid (expressed 

in years) 

d  –  time  interval  between  date  when  bond  was  sold  and  date  when  recovery  value  was  paid 

(expressed in years) 

rt – discount rate for moment of time from sale date to coupon payment date (annualized) 

rf – discount rate for moment of time from sale date to face value payment date (annualized) 

rd – discount rate for moment of time from sale date to recovery value payment date (annualized) 

 

As  it can  be seen  from  Appendix 3 risk  free rates are  listed  for each  year  from 1982 to 

2012 (which covers all bond’s sale dates) for periods of 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 

years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, 20 years and 30 years. There was some discontinuity in interest 

rates due to fact that for some years these rates were not present. Author calculated these rates in 

such way that they do not disturb pattern for all periods and across each year. Interest rates from 

this table do not cover all necessary data points for payments. In order to obtain appropriate rates

for maturities that are between dates in the table author used linear interpolation which does not 

influence  result  too  much  for  two  reasons:  such  approximation  is  in  line  with  yields  term 

structure  and  rates  for  closest  maturities  do  not  differ  too  much.  This  interpolation  was  the 

following and is presented in annualized rates for the calculated time period, since rates used are 

annualized: 

- 

- 

for periods less than 3 months was used rate r3m × (time period)/91 

for periods more than 3 months but less than 6 months was used rate r3m + (r6m - r3m) × 

(time period - 91) / (182 - 91) 

- 

for periods more than 6 months but less than 1 year was used rate r6m + (r1y - r6m) × (time 

period - 182) / (365 - 182) 

- 

for periods  more than 1  year but  less than 2  years was used rate r1y  + (r2y - r1y) × (time 

period - 365) / (730 - 365) 

- 

for periods more than 2 years but less than 3 years was used rate r2y + (r3y - r2y) × (time 

period - 730) / (1095 - 730) 

- 

for periods more than 3 years but less than 5 years was used rate r3y + (r5y - r3y) × (time 

period - 1095) / (1825 - 1095) 

- 

for periods more than 5 years but less than 7 years was used rate r5y + (r7y - r5y) × (time 

period - 1825) / (2555 - 1825) 

- 

for periods more than 7 years but less than 10 years was used rate r7y + (r10y - r7y) × (time 

period - 2555) / (3650 - 2555) 

- 

for periods  more than 10  years  but less than 20  years was used rate r10y + (r20y -  r10y) × 

(time period - 3650) / (7300 - 3650) 

- 

for periods  more than 20  years  but less than 30  years was used rate r20y + (r30y -  r20y) × 

(time period - 7300) / (10950 - 7300) 

where time period is measured in days. 

The  above  definition  was  used  to  make  conclusion  about  how  introduced  measure  is 

reflected  in  assigned  ratings.  In  previous  sections  author  utilized  equally  weighted  and  value 

weighted  portfolios  and  plotted  Lorenz  curves  as  well  as  provided  Gini  coefficients  for  them. 

This  way  of  accuracy  assessment  also  was  utilized  for  this  definition.  For  equally  weighted 

portfolio realized lifetime loss for each issue was calculated with this formula taking face value 

the  same  for  all  bonds  (namely  equal  to  1).  For  value  weighted  portfolio  face  value  was  used 

from  the  record  for  each  bond.  Realized  lifetime  loss  for  portfolio  of  bonds  was  calculated  as 

sum of realized lifetime losses for each entity in the portfolio. 

The second definition of realized lifetime loss is

which  is  relative  realized  lifetime  loss  taking  values  from  0  to  100%  by  the  construction; 

numerator is present value of cash flows that investor actually received, denominator is what was 

promised by bond’s term sheet. This definition was used further in  this research to estimate the 

number of “misclassified” or inconsistently rated issues. 

As  it  was  mentioned  above  two  subsamples  were  studied:  financial  and  non-financial 

industry’s debts. In this section author again considered the same bonds to make comparison of 

realized lifetime loss with previous results. 

Using  introduced  above  definitions  author  calculated  realized  lifetime  losses  for  each 

issue  in  the  sample  using  macro  code  written  on  MS  Excel  VBA.  Summary  for  the  financial 

debts is presented in the single diagram below

The  shape  repeats  the  diagram  for  the  relationship  between  rating  classes  and  default 

frequency.  The  explanation  is  essentially  the  same  as  it  was  given  for  that  case.  Diagrams  for 

defaults happened in 1 year and after 1 year since first rating assignment  are not illustrated here 

as  well  as  all  diagrams  for  value  weighted  portfolio  since  they  do  not  possess  any  remarkable 

difference compared to Diagram 11. Accuracy statistic for them will be reported in Table 6. 

 

As for subsample of non-financial industry debts it contains much more information and 

will be presented more detailed in the following diagrams:

The source: author’s calculations based on Moody’s DRS database 

The results obtained are  very  similar to ones  for relationship  between default  frequency 

and  rating  classes  in  terms  of  Gini  coefficients  dynamics  (one  can  compare  with  Table  4). 

Diagrams  for  both  considered  subsamples  indicate  that  information  about  newly  introduced 

measure is contained in ratings, especially in case of non-financial subsample: 

- 

realized  lifetime  loss  for  financial  industry  is  reflected  essentially  the  same  as  default 

frequency in the sample 

-  accuracy  of  the  new  measure  for  non-financial  issues  is  much  better  than  for  default 

frequency for both equally and value weighted portfolios and all time horizons. Equally 

weighted  portfolio  performs  also  better  than  value  weighted  as  measured  by  Gini 

coefficients for all periods (less than 1 year and more than 1 year). This may be again the 

case that rating agencies assign ratings better for lower sized issues 

- 

in the short run ratings in non-financial industry do perform better compared to the whole 

lifetime for value weighted portfolio and similarly for equally weighted. This means that 

ratings  have  higher  predictive  power  for  losses  in  the  short  run  as  measured  by  Gini 

coefficients. 

To  conclude  this  section,  ratings  turned  out  to  be  much  better  predictors  of  realized 

lifetime  loss  that  of  default  probability.  As  it  was  stated  in  Chapter  1  Moody’s  ratings  reflect 

both  probability  of  default  and  recovery  rate.  Results  above  show  that  ratings  contain  more 

information about realized lifetime loss thus this concept would be more appropriate measure of 

ratings quality than usual default probability and loss given default. 

 

 

37 

2.  Additional  way  for  rating  quality  assessment  using  realized 

lifetime loss 

Conclusions  of  the  previous  subsection  show  that  once  one  accounts  for  debt  industry 

namely, considers financial and non-financial subsamples separately it produces results that are 

in  line  with  each  other.  In  the  meantime,  when  industry  is  taken  into  account  the  information 

value about realized lifetime loss stored in ratings increases as measured by accuracy coefficients 

when  switching  to  non-financial  issues.  There  is  no  doubt  that  newly  introduced  measure  is 

indeed reflected in assigned ratings and is superior to simple approach of counting defaults and 

loss given default  as  measured  by Gini coefficients. Accuracy coefficients  for realized  lifetime 

loss  exceed  those  for  default  frequency  ones  in  all  cases  for  non-financial  industry.  The  next 

empirical  question  that  arises  is  how  to  use  realized  lifetime  loss  measure  to  assess  quality  of 

credit  ratings.  Using  the  second  introduced  definition  namely  relative  realized  lifetime  loss 

author analyzed the sample on the presence of incorrectly rated bonds. As “misclassified” rating 

author defined issues that were either underrated or overrated. In order to do this using relative 

realized lifetime loss the next definition was utilized: 

-  The  bond was considered to be underrated  if  its relative  lifetime  loss rate  is  lower than 

the average loss rate of the next superior rating category 

-  The bond was considered to be overrated if its relative lifetime loss rate is higher than the 

average loss rate of the next inferior rating category 

-  All other bonds were considered to be are consistently rated 

For example, assume that loss rate Ba bond is known and equal to 3%. Using the sample 

the average unconditional loss rates for B and Ba issues were calculated and equal to 5.6% for B 

rated bonds and 3.1% for Baa bonds. In this example according to the definition specified above 

the Ba rated bond would be treated as underrated since its loss rate is lower than the average loss 

rate of the next superior rating category, namely Baa. 

Utilizing this definition author counted inconsistently rated bonds by calculating relative 

loss rates for each bond in the sample using VBA macro for MS Excel, then calculated average 

loss  rates  for  each  rating  class  and  compared  these  values.  Results  are  the  following,  for  the 

financial subsample

These tables indicate the following: 

-  Number  of  “misclassified”  bonds  according  to the  stated  definition  is  very  low:  1.90% 

and 3.67% of total subsample’s amount. This indicates that on average ratings correctly 

account  for  possible  losses.  However,  almost  monotonous  increase  in  percentage  of 

incorrectly  rated  issues  is  observed  from  the  table:  it  is  equal  0%  for  the  highest  rated 

bonds  and  22.22%  (78.57%)  for  the  lowest  non-investment  category.  It  is  possible  that 

such  situation  may  take  place  due  to  incorrect  market  estimation  of  the  low  graded 

issue’s  value  30  days  after  default  which  makes  calculated  realized  lifetime  loss 

inaccurate. This result can be also explained by arguments listed in Perraudin and Taylor 

(2004),  namely  that  number  of  inconsistently  rated  issues  may  be  lower  if  account 

explicitly for risk premium. Nevertheless, author argues that obtained results are reliable 

within the framework of the model.  

-  For financial subsample, incorrect ratings are mostly assigned for “A” rated issues which 

are  overrated.  This  supports  previous  explanation  that  such  issues  were  rated  without 

taking  into  account  all  possible  risks.  As  it  is  known  this  led  to  significant  default 

numbers in the industry during crisis 2008 

-  For  non-financial  subsample  another  trend  is  seen,  if  rating  agency  assigns  incorrect 

rating  it  rates  bond  lower  than  should  according  to  the  above  definition.  Possible 

39 

 

explanation  may  be  that  in  case  of  uncertainty  about  the  debt  agency  chooses  prudent 

policy and prefers to rate below than above the actual rating. This is supported by Lorenz 

curves and accuracy coefficients, indicating that such debts were rated properly since the 

most part of defaults is accumulated by non-investment grade issues. 

3.  Relationship between ratings quality and characteristics of the 

bond 

3.1.  Regression model description and variables used 

Author’s  intention  was  to  investigate  whether  quality  of  assigned  ratings  depends  on 

certain  characteristics  of  a  bond.  Moody’s  DRS  database  contains  all  relevant  information  on 

each issue, namely debt class, debt seniority, collateral etc. It is interesting empirically whether 

these  characteristics  have  an  impact  on  ratings  quality.  In  order  to  do  this,  author  run  several 

types of regressions on all relevant independent variables presented in the Moody’s database. As 

for dependent variable two types of regressions were estimated. These two types of regressions 

use dependent variable which  indicates ratings  misclassification. The  first one  is ordinary  least 

squares regression with dependent variable equal to calculated realized lifetime loss for the issue 

less average loss for this bond’s rating category (called “lmal”). The second regression is logistic 

model  and  uses  dependent  variable  “misclass”  which  takes  value  of  1  if  bond  is  rated 

inconsistently and 0 otherwise. Acronym for the first variable stands for loss minus average loss, 

for the second misclassified. All regressions were performed in statistical analysis software Stata 

12. 

As  in the previous chapter, analysis would  be conducted  for financial and  non-financial 

subsamples  separately  to  make  results  comparable  with  ones  obtained  before.  Considering  the 

whole  information  available  in  the  database  author  decided  to  use  the  following  independent 

variables that may have explanatory power. They are listed below as well as  the hypothesis for 

these variables that were tested in the first type regression. Explanation for these variables for the 

second type regression would be given simultaneously with its results. 

-  debt class: all bonds in the sample belong to one of the five following debt classes 

a)  “REG”  -  Regular  Bond/Debenture.  These  bonds  are 

the  classical  debt 

instruments. Bondholders get paid only after secured creditors are paid, although 

they  will  usually  be  paid  before  common  stockholders.  They  are  issued  by 

companies to raise money. 

b)  “CON” 

-  Convertible/Exchange  Bond/Debenture.  These  bonds  can  be 

transformed  into  a  stated  quantity  of  shares  of  common  stock  or,  thus  are  the 

 

40 

hybrid type securities. They are most often issued by companies with a low credit 

rating. 

c)  “FMB” - First Mortgage Bonds. These bonds are usually secured by mortgage on 

real  estate/property  (although  this  is  not  the  case  in  the  used  sample).  If  issuer 

defaults bondholders have a claim on the underlying which has a priority over all 

other claims on this property. 

d)  “IRB” - Revenue Bonds. These bonds are usually secured by a particular venture. 

They  are  municipal  bonds  used  to  fund  revenue-generating  projects  and  backed 

such projects. 

e)  “SLB”  -  Secured  Lease  Obligation  Bond.  These  bonds  are  backed  by  lease 

payments  on  a  particular  asset  which  issuing  company  owns  and  receives  rent 

payments on it. 

According to the description listed above author was interested in whether it can be found 

empirically  that  some  of  debt  classes  can  explain  inconsistent  ratings.  In  order to  study 

this question 4 dummy variables named “debt_con”, “debt_fmb”, “debt_irb”, “debt_slb” 

equal  1  if  bond  belongs  to  a  particular  class  and  0  otherwise  were  introduced.  Regular 

bond was chosen as base category due to the highest frequency in the sample. 

Author’s intention was to test how these classes affect the dependent variable.  Here and 

after if it is not stated explicitly hypotheses are formulated for “lmal” dependent variable. 

Author expected to get positive coefficient for convertible bonds (“debt_con”) since they 

usually are issued by low rated companies so on average they should have higher losses 

than  regular  bonds.  Also  he  expected  to  obtain  negative  coefficients  for  first  mortgage 

bonds, revenue bonds and secured lease obligation bonds because they are often backed 

(as it is stated in description above) 

 

 

- 

time to maturity. This variable was simply created using information about sale date and 

maturity  date,  named  “time_to_mtr”  and  expressed  in  years.  Obviously  it  is  more 

difficult to predict default over a longer horizon, so hypothesis to test is that coefficient 

for “time_to_mtr” is positive and significant. 

 

-  debt seniority: this indicator should affect rating quality since priority of claims in case 

of bankruptcy do has influence on assigned rating. As a matter of fact senior debt would 

be  ranked  higher  than  junior,  all  other  factors  being  equal.  To  investigate  this  five 

broadly  presented  debt  seniority  classes  were  considered:  senior  secured,  senior 

unsecured,  senior  subordinated,  subordinated  and  junior  subordinated  ranked  from  the 

41 

highest  to  the  lowest  priority.  Consequently,  four  dummies  named  “seniority_su”, 

“seniority_sr”,  “seniority_sb”  and  “seniority_js” 

for  senior  unsecured,  senior 

subordinated, subordinated and junior subordinated  respectively were introduced. Senior 

secured class was chosen as base category. 

For  these  variables  hypothesis  to  test  was  that  coefficients  are  positive  since  the  base 

category  bondholders are paid  first  in case of default. Thus, it seems reasonable that  all 

other categories compared to senior secured should have higher losses (which is the case 

if coefficients are positive) 

-  debt currency: in spite of the fact that sample consists only of US issued bonds and most 

part is denominated in US dollars author decided to investigate the relationship between 

ratings  and  issue  currency.  For  that  purpose  currency  dummy  named  “curr”  was 

introduced,  it  takes  value  of  1  if  bond’s  currency  is  different  from  US  dollar  and  0 

otherwise. 

Hypothesis for this coefficient is that it should be positive. The idea behind it is that all 

bonds  considered  are  issued  in  the  United  States  and  those  that  are  denominated  in 

different  currency  have  higher  risks  due  to  exchange  rate  exposure  and  consequently 

have higher losses. 

-  payment  schedule  namely  coupon  frequency.  Sample  consists  of  5  different  coupon 

frequencies, 

thus  as  a 

rule  4  dummies  were 

introduced:  “coup_freq_mon”, 

“coup_freq_qtr”, “coup_freq_ann” and “coup_freq_acr” standing for monthly, quarterly, 

annual  and  accrued  frequencies  respectively.  To clarify  the  last  one  it  should  be  noted, 

that  Moody’s  assigns  accrued  frequency  for  issues  which  are  paying  coupons  and  face 

value simultaneously at maturity. Dummies were chosen to be equal 1 if bond has coupon 

schedule as named dummy and 0 otherwise; semiannual coupon frequency was chosen as 

base category. 

The hypothesis to test is that for issues with coupons paid more frequently than for those 

of  base  category,  namely  for  quarterly  and  monthly  coefficient  would  be  negative 

showing  that  such  issues  on  average  have  relatively  smaller  losses  because  investor 

receives payments more frequently (kind of risk reduction). On contrary, author expects 

to get positive coefficients for annual and accrued frequencies, especially for the last one. 

The intuition is that companies that are unable to make scheduled coupon payments are 

more  risky  that  is  why  they  choosing  policy  to  pay  out  coupon  and  face  value 

simultaneously. 

42 

 

 

 

 

 

-  collateral:  this  dummy  uses  information  from  column  in  the  database  which  contains 

binary  information  about  security’s  backing  (has  backing/does  not  have  backing). 

Variable “collateral” is equal 1 bond has a collateral and 0 otherwise. The hypothesis to 

test is that coefficient for this variable is negative and significant which will indicate that 

collateral reduces losses. 

- 

industry dummies. They were introduced to find out whether rating quality is different 

among  industries.  Because  author  again  considered  two  subsamples  separately,  these 

dummies will be different for subsamples. The following approach was applied: 

a)  For financial debts subsample the singe dummy was introduced  – “banks”. It 

is equal 1 if bond from this subsample was issued by bank and 0 otherwise. 

The idea was to check how losses differ for banks and non-banks keeping all 

other variables being equal. 

b)  For  non-financial  debts  six  dummies  were  introduced  –  “utilities”,  “energy”, 

“services”,  “media”,  “consumer_goods”  and  “transportation”  for  industries 

which names coincide with dummy’s names. As base category real sector was 

chosen. They are listed in Appendix 4. 

Again, introducing these dummies author wanted to find out how losses differ 

for  bonds  from  these  industries  compared  to  real  sector  bonds,  all  other 

variables being equal. 

3.2.  Regression results and discussion 

The  first step  is  again to study the  financial debts subsample.  For this purpose ordinary 

least  squares  regression  with  lmal  dependent  variable  was  estimated.  It  should  be  noted  that 

financial  subsample  contains only  convertible, revenue  and regular  bonds. That  is why  for this 

data dummies “debt_fmb” and “debt_slb” take zero values across all observations and should be 

omitted in estimation.

First that catches sight is that regression demonstrates extremely low R-squared = 0.0018 

which indicates that used explanatory variables explain even less than 0.2% of total variation in 

dependent variable. Nevertheless, regression as whole is significant which is indicated by F-test. 

  Signs for debt class coefficients contradict with author’s expectation but they are insignificant 

at any reasonable level and thus show that debt class has no impact on dependent variable. 

  Coefficient  for  “time_to_mtr”  is  significant  at  5%  level  and  positive  which  is  in  line  with 

hypothesis,  value  of  0.211  indicates  that  each  additional  year  increases  difference  between 

realized loss of the bond and average loss in given category for 0.211 million. 

  Signs for seniority classes coincide with expectation except for junior subordinated bonds for 

which it is insignificant at any reasonable level. The rest coefficients are also insignificant at 

5% level and show that in the sample debt classes inferior to senior secured have no effect on 

realized losses. 

  Sign  for  the  “curr”  is  negative  which  contradicts  the  hypothesis  but  is  insignificant  at  any 

reasonable level. Thus one can conclude that in the sample currency has no impact on realized 

lifetime losses 

  Signs  for  payment  schedule  are  in  line  with  expectations  except  accrued  frequency.  In  the 

meantime, coefficient  is significant only  for  monthly paid coupons. It states that  bonds with 

monthly  coupon  frequency  have  6.7  million  smaller  losses  than  for  semiannually  ones  all 

other variables being equal. 

 

44 

  Coefficient for collateral is negative and significant which coincides with expectation (bonds 

secured by collateral have 5.23 million smaller losses ceteris paribus) 

  Coefficient for “banks” is positive but insignificant in the sample. Thus no conclusion could 

be made about difference in losses for banks and non-banks. 

One possible explanation of low R-squared is that financial subsample consists mostly of 

non-defaulted  issues  (there  are  only  436  default  events  out  of  19055  observations).  Realized 

lifetime loss for non-defaulted debts is 0 which constitute the most part of the sample. It would 

be interesting to perform similar analysis for sample which contains higher number of defaulted 

debts.  

The  same  right  hand  side  variables  as  above  were  used  in  ordered  logistics  regression 

model.

Stata dropped out two variables since they both predicted perfectly bonds rated correctly 

(program treats failure as 0 outcome and dependent variable  is equal to zero means that bond is 

rated consistently). Table above shows that coefficients for time to maturity, currency, quarterly, 

annual and accrued coupon frequency, collateral and banks are all significant at 5% level. 

  For time to maturity a one year increase one should expect 0.07 increment in the log odds of 

going  “misclass”  in  1  that  is  of  bond  rated  inconsistently,  ceteris  paribus.  This  can  be 

explained by fact that it is more difficult to rate bonds with longer time to maturity. 

  Negative coupon frequency coefficients show that compared to  semiannual  frequency  bonds 

with  such  frequencies  have  lower  probabilities  to  be  rated  inconsistently.  This  result  is 

contradictory  on  the  first  sight  with  OLS  regression  results  and  hypotheses  for  annual  and 

accrued frequencies. It can be explained in the following way – most bonds in the sample with 

annual  and  accrued  frequencies  are  rated  consistently.  Among  inconsistently  rated  issues 

these  bonds  constitute  11  and  2  respectively.  Therefore,  such  signs  are  determined  by 

consistently rated issues and relationship is spurious. 

  Currency coefficient indicates that for non-dollar denominated debts the log odds of bond to 

be  rated  inconsistently  decline  by  1.35  all  other  variables  being  equal.  This  is  quite 

contradictory  result  since  such  issues  considered  to  be  more  risky  than  those  issues  in  US 

dollar,  but  is  again  explained  by  low  number  of  non-dollar  denominated  bonds  among 

defaulted issues (only 12). 

  Negative  collateral  coefficient  illustrates  the  statement  that  backed  bonds  have  lower 

probability to be rated inconsistently. This is in line with OLS regression results

Regression as for financial debts demonstrates low R-squared = 0.0149. Nevertheless, as 

whole it is significant which is indicated by F-test. 

  All debt class coefficients are insignificant at 5% level and thus show that debt class has no 

impact on dependent variable. 

  Coefficient for “time_to_mtr” description is essentially the same as for financial debts. 

  Signs  for  seniority  classes  for  significant  variables  differ  from  expected.  On  contrary  to 

financial  sample,  number  of  bonds  belonging  to  these  debt  classes  is  significant  among 

defaulted  (291  and  122  respectively)  and  non-defaulted  (1648  and  872).  One  possible 

explanation  is  that  on  this  dataset  such  bonds  experienced  lower  losses  than  senior  secured 

due to external factors that are not included in the model. 

  Sign for the “curr” is negative which contradicts the hypothesis and is significant at 5% level. 

In the meantime, defaulted issues contain only 6 out of 1228 debts denominated in currency 

different from US dollar. Thus, this effect is purely explained by non-defaulted issues and is 

spurious. 

 

47 

  Signs  for  payment  schedule  are  in  line  with  expectations  except  quarterly  frequency.  In  the 

meantime,  coefficient  is  significant  only  for  annual  and  accrued  coupons.  Result  is  in  line 

with expectation. 

  Coefficient  for  collateral  is  negative  which  coincides  with  expectation.  Although  it  is 

insignificant thus one can conclude that collateral has no impact on losses in this sample. 

  As  for industry dummies they show that bonds  from utilities and services  have  lower  losses 

compared  to  real  sector  and  debts  from  media  and  transportation  have  higher  losses 

respectively.  The  first  part  of  the  statement  can  be  explained  as  following  –  products  from 

such  industries  are  in  high  demand  even  in  recessions  and  even  if  default  event takes  place 

companies manage to recover without substantial losses. For the second part the explanation 

is the opposite –demand in downturns on their products declines significantly and companies 

experience big losses (use Appendix 4 for more insight about companies from these sectors). 

 

The same right hand side variables were used in ordered logistic regression for the whole 

subsample and only defaulted issues.

Logistic regression for non-financial subsample

As  in  financial  subsample  regression  Stata  dropped  out  two  variables  since  they  both 

predicted perfectly correctly rated bonds.  

  Coefficient for convertible bond is negative and significant indicating that log odds for bonds 

of  this debt class to be rated inconsistently decreases  by 0.783 compared to regular  bond. It 

was stated that convertible bonds are issued mostly by low rated companies. Therefore, such 

result  is  questionable.  There  are  only  90  convertible  bonds  out  of  1228  defaulted  and  this 

inference may be spurious due to small amount of debts. 

  Time to maturity remains positive but becomes insignificant. 

  All  debt  seniorities  are  significant  and  positive  (except  senior  unsecured)  showing  strong 

relationship between misclassified issues and bond seniorities 

  Currency coefficient  explanation  is the  same  as  before (it  is  mostly determined  by  correctly 

rated issues thus is spurious) 

  Coupon  frequencies  coefficients  are  also  all  significant  demonstrating 

impact  on 

misclassification 

  Negative  collateral  coefficient  illustrates  the  statement  that  backed  bonds  have  lower 

probability to be rated inconsistently. This is in line with OLS regression results 

 

49 

  Utilities,  energy,  services,  media,  consumer  goods  and  transportation  industries  also  reflect 

the dependence with inconsistent ratings. 

4.  Conclusions for Chapter 3 

1.  Lorenz curves for realized lifetime loss and default frequency are very similar in their 

shape.  Therefore  it  can  be  concluded  that  ratings  implicitly  contain  information  on 

possible losses and may be used by investors for such purpose. 

2.  Realized  lifetime  loss  compared  to  simple  default  counting  method  by  accuracy 

coefficients turned to outperform default frequency in all cases for non-financial issues 

and shows that can be used  for proper calculation of  inconsistently rated  issues  from 

financial industry 

3.  Thus, bond quality assessment using this new measure seems sensible and moreover, 

this  measure  implicitly  takes  into  account  default  and  loss  given  default  and  may  be 

used for purposes when these two indicators would need to be incorporated into single 

factor.  Also,  as  Moody’s  stated  their  rating  reflect  both  indicators,  it  seems  that  for 

bond ratings quality estimation realized loss is more appropriate measure due to higher 

accuracy than default frequency 

4.  Regression analysis showed low value of R-squared. Nevertheless author claims that it 

is not a matter of concern because results present significant effects (and as whole all 

regressions  are  significant  by  F-test  value).  Author’s  purpose  was  not  to  create  the 

model which explains all variation in realized losses but to find out which of the bond 

specific  variables  are  responsible  for  inconsistent  ratings  and  determine  the  signs  of 

their effects. Author achieved this goal and found that  

-  time  to  maturity  coefficient  is  positive  in  all  cases  and  almost  always  significant, 

which  is  in  line  with  Hilscher  and  Wilson  (2013)  and  Figlewski  et  al  (2012) 

meaning that default  is  more probable  for  issues  with  longer time to maturity and 

such issues experience higher losses and are rated inconsistently more often. 

-  collateral  coefficient  is  always  negative,  thus  showing  that  for  backed  bonds 

probability to get inconsistent rating is lower as well as realized losses 

-  industries  among  non-financial  debts  have  significant  impacts  on  realized  losses. 

This  can  be  explained  that  essential  goods  are  in  demand  even  in  economy’s 

downturns  thus  companies  from  these  industries  in  case  of  default  are  able  to 

recover. 

-  payment schedule barely explains misclassified bonds as well as realized losses 

 

50 

-  all  other  variables,  namely  debt  class,  seniority  and  currency  showed  significant 

effects in some cases but as it was explained these effects are spurious. 

5.  Finally, these variables explain only a small portion of the variation in  the dependent 

variable.  Author  conjectures  that  R-squared  may  be  sufficiently  increased  by 

introduction  external  variables,  like  firm-specific  and  macroeconomic:  profitability, 

balance  sheet  ratios,  GDP  growth,  unemployment  rate  etc.  It  would  be  interesting  to 

conduct similar exercise on this sample or on sample that will be presented with higher 

amount of defaults as it was stated earlier in the text.

Conclusion 

Author  dedicated  this  master  thesis  to  answer  on  the  three  questions  that  were  already 

stated in the Introduction. The summary of the obtained results is the following: 

1.  Ratings  do contain relevant information  for the  individual  investor. In particularly, they 

can be used for default frequency estimation and this result is in accordance with number 

of papers. Two types of debts were considered in this work: 

  Financial  debts  subsample  showed  that  ratings  moderately  explain  defaults  and  this  is 

possibly due to overlap of the sample period with  financial crisis 2008. This  subsample 

consists  mostly  of  “A”-“Aaa”  rated  issues  and  the  most  part  of  which  suffered  default 

events.  This  is  in  line  with  some  papers  which  state  that  number  of  defaults  increases 

dramatically in the recessions. Thus, financial crisis of 2008 revealed that rating agencies 

underestimate  risks  inherent  by  financial  debts.  Author  suggests  to  use  some  other 

explanatory variables to account correctly for default probability  

  Non-financial industry issues ratings seem to take correctly all risks and ratings itself can 

be  used  as  the  only  explanatory  variable,  especially  in  the  1  year  period  from  rating 

assignment. 

2.  Loss given default turned out to be poorly reflected in ratings. Only in 1 year period for 

non-financial debts ratings can be used for  loss given default prediction but still require 

additional source of information due to moderate Gini coefficients. 

3.  Newly  introduced  measure,  namely  realized  lifetime  loss  was  proved  to  be  superior  to 

simple default counting  method. It outperformed  default  frequency  in  all  cases  for non-

financial  issues  and  showed  the  same  accuracy  for  financial  debts.  Therefore,  due  to 

implicit  account  for  default  probability  and  loss  given  default  it  seems  to  be  more 

appropriate  measure  for  bond  quality  estimation.  Moreover,  this  measure  also  can  be 

used to count inconsistently rated bonds. 

4.  Author achieved his goal and found some significant effects in regression analysis: 

- 

time to maturity coefficient is positive in all cases and almost always significant proving 

the hypothesis that issues with long time to maturity are more probable to go into default 

and experience higher losses. Also they are more often to be rated inconsistently. 

-  collateral coefficient is always negative, thus showing that for backed bonds probability 

to get inconsistent rating is lower as well as realized losses 

- 

industries among non-financial debts have significant impacts on realized losses.  

To conclude, author had found answers on all stated questions. Open questions for further 

research are: 

 

52 

4.  How can rating  agencies  adjust their  methodology to reflect better loss given default  in 

their  ratings  and  would  it  be  more  appropriate  to  publish  realized  lifetime  loss  in  the 

reports instead of other two indicators? 

5.  Other  variables  from  regression  analysis,  namely  debt  class,  seniority  and  currency 

showed  significant  effects  in  some  cases  but  as  it  was  explained  these  effects  are 

spurious.  This  happened  due  to  low  amount  of  bonds  with  these  characteristics  among 

defaulted issues. It would be interesting to check these hypotheses on more broad sample 

6.  Author’s  purpose  was  to  find  which  of  the  bond  specific  variables  are  responsible  for 

inconsistent  ratings  and  determine  the  signs  of  their  effects.  Listed  above  variables  do 

have  impact  on  the  dependent  variable  but  do  not  explain  all  variation.  Introduction  of 

firm-specific  and  macroeconomic  variables  can  resolve  this  problem  and  it  would  be 

interesting to do this exercise in further studies.
